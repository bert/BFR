<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 19 Amber and Brown American Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 19B California Common

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A toasty and caramelly, fairly bitter,
standard-strength beer with an interesting fruitiness and
rustic, woody hop character. Smooth and well carbonated.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to high herbal, resinous, floral, or minty
hops. Light fruitiness acceptable. Low to moderate caramel or
toasty malt supports the hops.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium amber to light copper color. Generally
clear. Moderate off-white head with good retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderately malty with a pronounced hop bitterness.
The malt character usually has toast (not roast) and caramel
flavors. Low to moderately high hop flavor, usually showing
rustic, traditional American hop qualities (often herbal,
resinous, floral, minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a
lingering hop bitterness and a firm, grainy malt flavor. Light
fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise clean.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high
carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> This style is narrowly defined around the
prototypical Anchor Steam example, although allowing other
typical ingredients of the era. Northern Brewer hops are not a
strict requirement for the style. Modern American and New
World-type hops (especially citrusy ones) are inappropriate.

<b>History:</b> American West Coast original, brewed originally as
Steam Beer during the Gold Rush era. Large shallow open
fermenters (coolships) were used to compensate for the lack of
refrigeration and to take advantage of the cool temperatures in
the San Francisco Bay area. Modern versions are based on
Anchor Brewing re-launching the style in the 1970s.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Pale ale malt, non-citrusy hops
(often Northern Brewer), small amounts of toasted malt or
crystal malts. Lager yeast; however, some strains (often with
the mention of “California” in the name) work better than
others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60 °F)
typically used. Note that some German yeast strains produce
inappropriate sulfury character.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Superficially similar to an American
Amber Ale, but with specific choices for malt and hopping –
the hop flavor and aroma is traditional (not modern) American
hops, malt flavors are toastier, the hopping is always assertive,
and a warm-fermented lager yeast is used. Less attenuated, less
carbonated and less fruity than Australian Sparkling ale.
