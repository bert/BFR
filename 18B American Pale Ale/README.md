<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 18 Pale American Ale

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b>  18B American Pale Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> An average-strength, hop-forward, pale
American craft beer with sufficient supporting malt to make
the beer balanced and drinkable. The clean hop presence can
reflect classic or modern American or New World hop varieties
with a wide range of characteristics.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to moderately-high hop aroma from
American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of
possible characteristics, including citrus, floral, pine, resin,
spice, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon. None of these
specific characteristics are required, but a hoppy aroma should
be apparent. Low to moderate neutral to grainy maltiness
supports the hop presentation, and can show low amounts of
specialty malt character (e.g., bread, toast, biscuit, caramel).
Fruity esters optional, up to moderate in strength. Fresh dry-
hop aroma optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Pale golden to amber. Moderately large white to
off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear.

<b>Flavor:</b> Hop and malt character similar to aroma (same
intensities and descriptors apply). Caramel flavors are often
absent or fairly restrained, but are acceptable as long as they
don’t clash with the hops. Moderate to high bitterness. Clean
fermentation profile. Fruity yeast esters can be moderate to
none, although many hop varieties are quite fruity. Medium to
dry finish. The balance is typically towards the late hops and
bitterness; the malt presence should be supportive, not
distracting. Hop flavor and bitterness often linger into the
finish, but the aftertaste should generally be clean and not
harsh. Fresh dry-hop flavor optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to high
carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency or
harshness.

<b>Comments:</b> Modern American versions are often just lower
gravity IPAs. Traditionally was a style that allowed for
experimentation with hop varieties and usage methods, which
can now often be found as international adaptations in
countries with an emerging craft beer market. Judges should
allow for characteristics of modern American or New World
hops as they are developed and released.

<b>History:</b> A modern American craft beer era adaptation of
English pale ale, reflecting indigenous ingredients. Sierra
Nevada Pale Ale was first made in 1980 and helped popularize
the style. Prior to the explosion in popularity of IPAs, this style
was the most well-known and popular of American craft beers.
