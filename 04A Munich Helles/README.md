<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 4 Pale Malty European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 04A Munich Helles

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A gold-colored German lager with a
smooth, malty flavor and a soft, dry finish. Subtle spicy, floral,
or herbal hops and restrained bitterness help keep the balance
malty but not sweet, which helps make this beer a refreshing,
everyday drink.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate grainy-sweet malt aroma. Low to
moderately-low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma. Pleasant,
clean fermentation profile, with malt dominating the balance.
The freshest examples will have more of a malty-sweet aroma.

<b>Appearance:</b> Pale yellow to pale gold. Clear. Persistent
creamy white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderately malty start with the suggestion of
sweetness, moderate grainy-sweet malt flavor with a soft,
rounded palate impression, supported by a low to medium-low
bitterness. Soft and dry finish, not crisp and biting. Low to
moderately-low spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor. Malt
dominates hops in the palate, finish, and aftertaste, but hops
should be noticeable. No residual sweetness, simply the
impression of maltiness with restrained bitterness. Clean
fermentation profile.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium body. Medium carbonation. Smooth,
well-lagered character.

<b>Comments:</b> Very fresh examples can have a more prominent
malt and hop character that fades over time, as is often noticed
in exported beers. Helles in Munich tends to be a lighter
version than those outside the city. May be called Helles
Lagerbier.

<b>History:</b> Created in Munich in 1894 to compete with pale
Pilsner-type beers, often first credited to Spaten. More popular
in Southern Germany.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Continental Pilsner malt.
Traditional German hops. Clean German lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Similar in malt balance and bitterness to
Munich Dunkel, but less malty-sweet in nature and pale rather
than dark and rich. More body and malt presence than a
German Pils, but less crisp and with less hop character
throughout. Similar malt profile as a German Helles
Exportbier, but with fewer hops in the balance and slightly less
alcohol. Less body and alcohol than a Festbier.
