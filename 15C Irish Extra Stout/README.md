<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 15 Irish Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 15C Irish Extra Stout

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A fuller-bodied black beer with a
pronounced roasted flavor, often similar to coffee and dark
chocolate with some malty complexity. The balance can range
from moderately bittersweet to bitter, with the more balanced
versions having up to moderate malty richness and the bitter
versions being quite dry.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to moderately high coffee-like aroma, often
with slight dark chocolate, cocoa, biscuit, vanilla, or roasted
grain secondary notes. Medium-low esters optional. Hop
aroma low to none, may be lightly earthy or spicy, but is
typically absent. Malt and roast dominate the aroma.

<b>Appearance:</b> Jet black. Opaque. A thick, creamy, persistent
tan head is characteristic.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate to moderately high dark-roasted grain or
malt flavor with a medium to medium-high bitterness. The
finish can be dry and coffee-like to moderately balanced with
up to moderate caramel or malty sweetness. Typically has
roasted coffee-like flavors, but also often has a dark chocolate
character in the palate, lasting into the finish. Background
mocha or biscuit flavors are often present and add complexity.
Medium-low fruitiness optional. Medium earthy or spicy hop
flavor optional. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as
is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for
interpretation by brewers.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to full body, with a somewhat
creamy character. Moderate carbonation. Very smooth. May
have a light astringency from the roasted grains, although
harshness is undesirable. A slightly warming character may be
detected.

<b>Comments:</b> Traditionally a stronger, bottled product with a
range of equally valid possible interpretations, varying most
frequently in roast flavor and sweetness. Most traditional Irish
commercial examples are in the 5.6 to 6.0 % ABV range.

<b>History:</b> Same roots as Irish Stout, but as a stronger product.
Guinness Extra Stout (Extra Superior Porter, later Double
Stout) was first brewed in 1821, and was primarily a bottled
product.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Similar to Irish Stout. May
have additional dark crystal malts or dark sugars.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Midway between an Irish Stout and a
Foreign Extra Stout in strength and flavor intensity, although
with a similar balance. More body, richness, and often malt
complexity than an Irish Stout. Black in color, not brown like
an English Porter.
