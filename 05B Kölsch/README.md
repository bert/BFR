<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 5 Pale Bitter European Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 05B Kölsch

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A subtle, brilliantly clear, pale beer
with a delicate balance of malt, fruit, and hop character,
moderate bitterness, and a well-attenuated but soft finish.
Freshness makes a huge difference with this beer, as the
delicate character can fade quickly with age.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to very low grainy-sweet malt aroma. A subtle
fruit aroma (apple, pear, or sometimes cherry) is optional, but
welcome. Low floral, spicy, or herbal hop aroma optional. The
intensity of aromatics is fairly subtle but generally balanced,
clean, fresh, and pleasant.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium yellow to light gold. Brilliant clarity.
Has a delicate white head that may not persist.

<b>Flavor:</b> A delicate flavor balance between malt, fruitiness,
bitterness, and hops, with a clean, well-attenuated finish. The
medium to medium-low grainy maltiness may have very light
bready or honey notes. The fruitiness can have an almost
imperceptible sweetness. Medium-low to medium bitterness.
Low to moderately-high floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor; most
are medium-low to medium. May have a neutral-grainy to light
malty sweet impression at the start. Soft, rounded palate.
Finish is soft, dry, and slightly crisp, not sharp or biting. No
noticeable residual sweetness. While the balance between the
flavor components can vary, none are ever strong.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body; most are
medium-light. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Smooth
and soft, but well-attenuated and not heavy. Not harsh.

<b>Comments:</b> A traditional top-fermented, lagered beer from
Cologne, Germany (Köln). Köln breweries differentiate
themselves through balance, so allow for a range of variation
within the style when judging. Drier versions may seem
hoppier or more bitter than the IBU levels might suggest. The
delicate flavor profile does not age well, so be alert for
oxidation defects. Served in Köln in a tall, narrow 20cl glass
called a Stange.

<b>History:</b> Köln has a top-fermenting brewing tradition since
the Middle Ages, but the beer now known as Kölsch was
developed in the late 1800s as an alternative to pale lagers.
Bottom fermentation was actually prohibited in Cologne.
Kölsch is an appellation protected by the Kölsch Konvention
(1986), and is restricted to breweries in and around Köln. The
Konvention simply defines the beer as a “light, highly
attenuated, hop-accentuated, clear, top-fermenting Vollbier”.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Traditional German hops.
German Pils, Pale, or Vienna malt. Attenuative, clean German
ale yeast. Occasional small use of wheat malt. Current
commercial practice is to ferment around 15 °C, cold condition
near freezing for up to a month, and serve fresh.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Can be mistaken for a Cream Ale or
somewhat subtle German Pils.
