<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 0X5 New Zealand Pilsner

Suggested style placement: Category 12 (Pale Commonwealth
Beer)

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A pale, dry, golden-colored, cleanly-
fermented beer showcasing the characteristic tropical, citrusy,
fruity, grassy New Zealand-type hops. Medium body, soft
mouthfeel, and smooth palate and finish, with a neutral to
bready malt base provide the support for this very drinkable,
refreshing, hop-forward beer.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium to high hop aroma reflective of modern New
World hop varieties, often showcasing tropical fruit, citrus
(lime, white grapefruit), gooseberry, honeydew melon, with a
light green bell pepper or grassy aspect. Medium-low to
medium malt in support, with a neutral to bready-crackery
quality. Very low DMS acceptable but not required. Neutral,
clean yeast character, optionally with a very light sulfury
quality. The hop character should be most prominent in the
balance, but some malt character must be evident.

<b>Appearance:</b> Straw to deep gold in color, but most examples
are yellow-gold. Generally quite clear to brilliant clarity;
haziness is a fault. Creamy, long-lasting white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to high hop bitterness, cleanly bitter not
harsh, most prominent in the balance and lasting into the
aftertaste. Medium to high hop flavor with similar
characteristics as the aroma (tropical, citrus, gooseberry,
melon, grass). Medium to medium-low malt flavor, grainy-
sweet, bready, or crackery. Clean fermentation profile
(fermentation esters are a fault). Dry to off-dry with a clean,
smooth finish and bitter but not harsh aftertaste. The malt may
suggest an impression of sweetness but the beer should not be
literally sweet. The finish may be dry but not seem crisp or
biting. The balance should always be bitter, but the malt flavor
must be noticeable.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-light body. Medium to
medium-high carbonation. Smoothness is the most prominent
impression. Never harsh nor astringent.

<b>Comments:</b> The hop aromatics often have a similar quality
as many New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc wines, with tropical
fruit, grassy, melon, and lime aromatics. Often brewed as a
hybrid style in New Zealand using a neutral ale yeast at cool
temperatures. Limiting the sulfur content of the finished
product is important since it can clash with the hop character.

<b>History:</b> Largely defined by the original created at Emerson’s
Brewery in the mid-1990s, New Zealand Pilsner has expanded
in character as the varieties of New Zealand hops have
expanded in number and popularity.

<b>Ingredients:</b> New Zealand hop varieties, such as Motueka,
Riwake, Nelson Sauvin, often with Pacific Jade for bittering.
Other new world varieties from Australia or the US may be
used, if they have similar characteristics. Pale base malts,
Pilsner or pale types, perhaps with a small percentage of wheat
malt. Fairly low-mineral water, typically with more chloride
than sulfate. Clean lager yeast or very neutral ale yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Compared to a German Pils, not as crisp
and dry in the finish with a softer, maltier presentation and a
fuller body. Compared to a Czech Premium Pale Lager, less
malt complexity, a cleaner fermentation. Similar in balance to a
Kolsch or British Golden Ale, but with a hoppier aroma.
Compared to any of these German styles, showcasing New
Zealand hop varieties with tropical, citrusy, fruity, grassy
characteristics, often with a white wine-like character. Should
not be as hoppy or bitter in balance as an IPA.
