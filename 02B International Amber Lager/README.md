<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 2 International Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 02B International Amber Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A smooth, easily-drinkable, malty
amber lager with a flavorful caramel or toast character. Usually
fairly well-attenuated, often with an adjunct quality and
restrained bitterness.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to moderate grainy malt aroma often with very
low to moderate caramel or toasty malt accents. Occasionally,
nutty or biscuity, but never roasty. Low, unobtrusive floral or
spicy hop aroma. Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Appearance:</b> Golden-amber to reddish-copper color. Bright
clarity. White to off-white foam stand which may not last.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to moderate malt flavor, often with caramel or
toasty-bready flavors. Low to medium-low corny sweetness
optional. Low to moderate bitterness, giving the beer a malty to
fairly even balance. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, or floral
hop flavor. Clean fermentation profile. The finish is moderately
dry with a moderately malty aftertaste. The beer may seem a
touch sweet if the bitterness level is low.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Light to medium body. Medium to high
carbonation. Smooth. Some examples can be slightly creamy.
Comments: A wide spectrum of mass-market amber lagers
either developed independently in various countries, or
describing rather generic amber beers with more historical
relevance that eventually changed into indistinguishable
products in modern times.

<b>History:</b> Varies by country, but generally represents either an
adaptation of the mass-market International Pale Lager, or an
evolution of indigenous styles into more generic products.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Two-row or six-row base malt.
Color malts such as Victory, amber, or roast. May be all malt or
use adjuncts. Sugars or coloring agents possible. Caramel malt.
European or American hops.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Less well-developed malt flavor than a
Vienna Lager, often with an adjunct taste. Less robust flavor
and bitterness than Altbier.
