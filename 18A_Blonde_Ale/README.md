<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 18 Pale American Ale

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 18A Blonde Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> Easy-drinking, approachable, malt-
oriented American craft beer, often with interesting fruit, hop,
or character malt notes. Well-balanced and clean, is a
refreshing pint without aggressive flavors.

<b>Aroma:</b> Light to moderate malty aroma, generally neutral or
grainy, possibly with a light bread or caramel note. Low to
moderate fruitiness is optional, but acceptable. May have a low
to medium hop aroma, and can reflect almost any hop variety
although citrusy, floral, fruity, and spicy notes are common.
Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Appearance:</b> Light yellow to deep gold in color. Clear to
brilliant. Low to medium white head with fair to good
retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Initial soft maltiness, but can also have light character
malt flavor (e.g., bread, toast, biscuit, wheat). Caramel flavors
usually absent; if present, they are typically low-color caramel
or honey notes. Low to medium fruity esters optional, but are
welcome. Light to moderate hop flavor (any variety), but
shouldn’t be overly aggressive. Medium-low to medium
bitterness, but the balance is normally towards the malt or
even between malt and hops. Finishes medium-dry to slightly
malty; an impression of sweetness is often an expression of
lower bitterness than actual residual sweetness. Clean
fermentation profile.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Medium to high
carbonation. Smooth without being heavy.

<b>Comments:</b> Oxidized versions can develop caramel or honey
notes, which should not be mistaken for similar malt-derived
flavors. Sometimes known as Golden Ale or simply a Gold.

<b>History:</b> An American craft beer style produced as a faster-
produced alternative to standard American lagers. First
believed to be produced in 1987 at Catamount. Often
positioned as an entry-level house ale.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Generally all-malt, but can
include wheat malt or sugar adjuncts. Any hop variety can be
used. Clean American, lightly fruity English, or Kölsch yeast.
May also be made with lager yeast, or cold-conditioned.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Typically has more flavor than American
Lager and Cream Ale. Less bitterness than an American Pale
Ale. Perhaps similar to some maltier examples of Kölsch.
