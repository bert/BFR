<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 03A Czech Pale Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing,
hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the
stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer but in a
lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.

<b>Aroma:</b> Light to moderate bready-rich malt combined with
light to moderate spicy or herbal hop bouquet; the balance
between the malt and hops may vary. Faint hint of caramel is
acceptable. Light (but never intrusive) diacetyl and light, fruity
esters are optional. No sulfur.

<b>Appearance:</b> Light yellow to deep gold color. Brilliant to very
clear, with a long-lasting, creamy white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium-low to medium bready-rich malt flavor with
a rounded, hoppy finish. Low to medium-high spicy or herbal
hop flavor. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. Flavorful
and refreshing. Low diacetyl or fruity esters are optional, but
should never be overbearing.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Moderate
carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> The Czech name of the style is světlé výčepní
pivo.

<b>History:</b> Josef Groll initially brewed two types of pale beer in
1842–3, a výčepní and a ležák, with the smaller beer having
twice the production; Evan Rail speculates that these were
probably 10 °P and 12 °P beers, but that the výčepní could have
been weaker. This is the most consumed type of beer in the
Czech Republic at present.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Soft water with low sulfate and
carbonate content. Traditional Czech hops. Czech Pilsner malt.
Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft,
rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> A lighter-bodied, lower-intensity,
refreshing, everyday version of Czech Premium Pale Lager.
