<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 4 Pale Malty European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 04B Festbier

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A smooth, clean, pale German lager
with a moderately strong malty flavor and a light hop
character. Deftly balances strength and drinkability, with a
palate impression and finish that encourages drinking.
Showcases elegant German malt flavors without becoming too
heavy or filling.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate malty richness, with an emphasis on toasty-
doughy aromatics and an impression of sweetness. Low to
medium-low floral, herbal, or spicy hops. The malt should not
have a deeply toasted, caramel, or biscuity quality. Clean lager
fermentation profile.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep yellow to deep gold color; should not have
amber hues. Bright clarity. Persistent white to off-white foam
stand. Most commercial examples are pale gold in color.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to medium-high malty flavor initially, with a
lightly toasty, bread dough quality and an impression of soft
malty richness. Medium to medium-low bitterness, definitely
malty in the balance. Well-attenuated and crisp, but not dry.
Medium-low to medium floral, herbal, or spicy hop flavor.
Clean fermentation profile. The taste is mostly of Pils malt, but
with slightly toasty hints. The bitterness is supportive, but still
should yield a malty, flavorful finish.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium body, with a smooth, somewhat creamy
texture. Medium carbonation. Alcohol strength barely
noticeable as warming, if at all.

<b>Comments:</b> This style represents the modern German beer
served at Oktoberfest (although it is not solely reserved for
Oktoberfest; it can be found at many other ‘fests’), and is
sometimes called Wiesn (“the meadow” or local name for the
Oktoberfest festival). We chose to call this style Festbier since
by German and EU regulations, Oktoberfestbier is a protected
appellation for beer produced at large breweries within the
Munich city limits for consumption at Oktoberfest. Other
countries are not bound by these rules, so many craft breweries
in the US produce beer called Oktoberfest, but based on the
traditional style described in these guidelines as Märzen. May
be called Helles Märzen.

<b>History:</b> Since 1990, the majority of beer served at
Oktoberfest in Munich has been this style. Export beer
specifically made for the United States is still mainly of the
traditional amber style, as are US-produced interpretations.
Paulaner first created the golden version in the mid-1970s
because they thought the traditional Oktoberfest was too
filling. So they developed a lighter, more drinkable but still
malty version that they wanted to be “more poundable”
(according to the head brewer at Paulaner). But the actual type
of beer served at Oktoberfest is set by a Munich city committee.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Majority Pils malt, but with
some Vienna or Munich malt to increase maltiness. Differences
in commercial examples are mostly due to different maltsters
and yeast, not major grist differences.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Less intense and less richly toasted than
a Märzen. Stronger than a Munich Helles, with a bit more
body, and hop and malt flavor. Less rich in malt intensity than
a Helles Bock. The malt complexity is similar to a higher-
gravity Czech Premium Pale Lager, although without the
associated hops.
