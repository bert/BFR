<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 20 American Porter and Stout

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 20A American Porter

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A malty, bitter, and often somewhat
hoppy dark beer with a balanced, roasted, and frequently
chocolatey character.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium-light to medium-strong roast aroma, often
with a chocolate, light coffee, or lightly burnt character,
sometimes with a background caramel or toffee sweetness, or a
malty richness. The resiny, earthy, or floral hop character can
vary from low to high. Moderate fruity esters optional. Should
not seem sharp, acrid, or acidic. The malt-hop balance can
vary, but it should always have a roasted malt aroma.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium brown to very dark brown, often with
ruby- or garnet-like highlights. Can approach black in color.
Clear, if not opaque. Full, tan-colored head with moderately
good head retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderately strong roasted flavor, often with a
chocolate and lightly burnt character, sometimes with a sweet
caramel or malty richness in support. Medium to high
bitterness, and a dry to medium-sweet finish. Dark malts may
sharpen this impression, but should not add an acrid, burnt, or
harsh flavor. Low to high resiny, earthy, or floral hop flavor,
which should not clash with the dark malt. Dry-hopped
versions may have a fresh hop or resiny flavor. Moderate fruity
esters optional. Should not have an acidic bite.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-full body. Moderately low to
moderately high carbonation. Stronger versions may have a
slight alcohol warmth. May have a slight dark malt astringency,
but this character should not be strong.

<b>Comments:</b> Sometimes called Robust Porter, becoming
increasingly hard to find. A rather broad style open to
interpretation by the brewer. Dark malt intensity and flavor
can vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop
character, or significant fermentation byproducts; thus may
seem to have an “American” or “British” character.

<b>History:</b> A stronger, more aggressive version of earlier Pre-
Prohibition Porters or English Porters, first brewed in the
modern craft beer era (introduced in 1974). This style describes
the modern craft version; see Historical Beer: Pre-Prohibition
Porter for the older US version.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Pale base malt, frequently
crystal malt. Dark malts, often black malt or chocolate malt.
American hops typically used for bittering, but US or UK
finishing hops can be used. Ale yeast can either be clean US
versions or characterful English varieties.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> More bitter and often stronger with more
dark malt qualities and dryness than English Porters or Pre-
Prohibition Porters. Less strong and assertive than American
Stouts.
