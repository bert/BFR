<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 03D Czech Dark Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A rich, dark, malty Czech lager with a
roast character that can vary from almost absent to quite
prominent. Malty balance and an interesting and complex
flavor profile, with variable levels of hopping that provides a
range of possible interpretations.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium to medium-high rich, deep, sometimes sweet
maltiness, with optional qualities such as bread crusts, toast,
nuts, cola, dark fruit, or caramel. Roasted malt characters such
as chocolate or sweetened coffee can vary from moderate to
none but should not overwhelm the base malt character. Low
to moderate spicy hop aroma optional. Low diacetyl and low to
moderate fruity esters (plums or berries) may be present.

<b>Appearance:</b> Dark copper to almost black color, often with a
red or garnet tint. Clear to bright clarity. Large, off-white to
tan, persistent head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to medium-high deep, complex maltiness
dominates, typically with malty-rich Maillard products and a
light to moderate residual malt sweetness. Malt flavors such as
caramel, toast, nuts, licorice, dried dark fruit, chocolate, or
coffee may also be present, with very low to moderate roast
character. Low to moderate spicy hop flavor. Moderate to
medium-low bitterness, but should be perceptible. Balance can
vary from malty to relatively well-balanced to gently hop-
forward. Low to moderate diacetyl and light plum or berry
esters may be present.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-full body, considerable
mouthfeel without being heavy or cloying. Moderately creamy
in texture. Smooth. Moderate to low carbonation. Can have a
slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.

<b>Comments:</b> This style is a combination of the Czech styles
tmavý ležák (11–12.9 °P) and tmavé speciální pivo (13–14.9
°P). More modern examples are drier and have higher
bitterness while traditional versions often have IBUs in the 18–
20 range with a sweeter balance.

<b>History:</b> The U Fleků brewery has been operating in Prague
since 1499, and produces the best-known version. Many small,
new breweries are brewing this style.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Pilsner and dark caramel malts
with the addition of debittered roasted malts are most
common, but additions of Vienna or Munich malt are also
appropriate. Low mineral content water. Traditional Czech
hops. Czech lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> The beer is the Czech equivalent of a
dark lager ranging in character from Munich Dunkel to
Schwarzbier, but typically with greater malt richness and hop
aroma, flavor, and bitterness.
