<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 17 Strong British Ale

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 17A British Strong Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> An ale of respectable alcoholic
strength, traditionally bottled-conditioned and cellared. Can
have a wide range of interpretations, but most will have varying
degrees of malty richness, late hops and bitterness, fruity
esters, and alcohol warmth. The malt and adjunct flavors and
intensity can vary widely, but any combination should result in
an agreeable palate experience.

<b>Aroma:</b> Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex
blend of dried-fruit, caramel, nuts, toffee, or other specialty
malt aromas. Some alcohol notes are acceptable, but shouldn’t
be hot or solventy. Hop aromas can vary widely, but typically
have earthy, resiny, fruity, or floral notes. The balance can vary
widely, but most examples will have a blend of malt, fruit,
hops, and alcohol in varying intensities.

<b>Appearance:</b> Amber to dark reddish-brown color; many are
fairly dark. Generally clear, although darker versions may be
almost opaque. Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored
head with average retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to high malt character often rich with nutty,
toffee, or caramel flavors. Light chocolate notes are sometimes
found in darker beers. May have interesting flavor complexity
from brewing sugars. Balance is often malty, but may be well
hopped, which affects the impression of maltiness. Moderate
fruity esters are common, often with a dark fruit or dried fruit
character. The finish may vary from medium dry to somewhat
sweet. Alcoholic strength should be evident, not overwhelming.
Low diacetyl optional, but generally not desirable.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to full, chewy body. Alcohol warmth is
often evident and always welcome. Low to moderate
carbonation. Smooth texture.

<b>Comments:</b> An entry category more than a style; the strength
and character of examples can vary widely. Fits in the style
space between normal gravity beers and Barley Wines. Can
include pale malty-hoppy beers, English winter warmers,
strong dark milds, smaller Burton ales, and other unique beers
in the general gravity range that don’t fit other categories.
Judges should allow for a significant range in character, as long
as the beer is within the alcohol strength range and has an
interesting ‘British’ character, it likely fits the style.

<b>History:</b> A collection of unrelated minor styles, each of which
has its own heritage. Do not use this category grouping to infer
a historical relationship between examples – none is intended.
This is a modern British specialty judging category where the
‘special’ attribute is alcohol level.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Grists vary, often based on pale
malt with caramel and specialty malts. Some darker examples
suggest a light use of dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt).
Sugary and starchy adjuncts (e.g., maize, flaked barley, wheat)
are common. Finishing hops are traditionally English.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Significant overlap in gravity with Old
Ale, but not having an aged character. A wide range of
interpretations is possible. Should not be as rich or strong as an
English Barley Wine. Stronger than the stronger everyday
Strong Bitter, British Brown Ale, and English Porter. More
specialty malt or sugar character than American Strong Ale.
