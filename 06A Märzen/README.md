<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 6 Amber Malty European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 06A Märzen

<b>Overall Impression:</b> An amber, malty German lager with a
clean, rich, toasty, bready malt flavor, restrained bitterness,
and a well-attenuated finish. The overall malt impression is
soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich malty aftertaste that is
never cloying or heavy.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate malty aroma, typically rich, bready,
somewhat toasty, with light bread crust notes. Clean lager
fermentation character. Very low floral, herbal, or spicy hop
aroma optional. Caramel-sweet, biscuity-dry, or roasted malt
aromas are inappropriate. Very light alcohol might be detected,
but should never be sharp. Clean, elegant malt richness should
be the primary aroma.

<b>Appearance:</b> Amber-orange to deep reddish-copper color;
should not be golden. Bright clarity, with persistent, off-white
foam stand.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate to high rich malt flavor often initially
suggests sweetness, but the finish is moderately-dry to dry.
Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready,
toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate, and the floral,
herbal, or spicy hop flavor is low to none. Hops provide
sufficient balance that the malty palate and finish do not seem
sweet. The aftertaste is malty, with the same elegant, rich malt
flavors lingering. Noticeable sweet caramel, dry biscuit, or
roasted flavors are inappropriate. Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium body, with a smooth, creamy texture that
often suggests a fuller mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Fully
attenuated, without a sweet or cloying impression. May be
slightly warming, but the strength should be relatively hidden.

<b>Comments:</b> Modern domestic German Oktoberfest versions
are golden – see the Festbier style for this version. Export
German versions (to the United States, at least) are typically
orange-amber in color, have a distinctive toasty malt character,
and are often labeled Oktoberfest. Many craft versions of
Oktoberfest are based on this style. Historic versions of the
beer tended to be darker, towards the brown color range, but
there have been many ‘shades’ of Märzen (when the name is
used as a strength); this style description specifically refers to
the stronger amber lager version. The modern Festbier can be
thought of as a lighter-bodied, pale Märzen by these terms.

<b>History:</b> As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger “March
beer” in March and lagered in cold caves over the summer.
Modern versions trace back to the lager developed by Spaten in
1841, contemporaneous to the development of Vienna lager.
However, the Märzen name is much older than 1841 – the early
ones were dark brown, and the name implied a strength band
(14 °P) rather than a style. The amber lager style served at
Oktoberfest from 1872 until 1990 when the golden Festbier was
adopted as the standard festival beer.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Grist varies, although
traditional German versions emphasized Munich malt. The
notion of elegance is derived from the finest quality
ingredients, particularly the base malts. A decoction mash is
traditional, and enhances the rich malt profile.
Style Comparison: Not as strong and rich as a Dunkles
Bock. More malt depth and richness than a Festbier, with a
heavier body and slightly less hops. Less hoppy but equally
malty as a Czech Amber Lager, but with a different malt profile.
