<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 15A Irish Red Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> An easy-drinking pint, often with
subtle flavors. Slightly malty in the balance sometimes with an
initial soft toffee or caramel sweetness, a slightly grainy-
biscuity palate, and a touch of roasted dryness in the finish.
Some versions can emphasize the caramel and sweetness more,
while others will favor the grainy palate and roasted dryness.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to moderate malt aroma, either neutral-grainy or
with a lightly caramel, toast, or toffee character. Very light
buttery character optional. Low earthy or floral hop aroma
optional. Quite clean.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium amber to medium reddish-copper
color. Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head, average
persistence.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate to very little caramel malt flavor and
sweetness, rarely with a light buttered toast or toffee-like
quality. The palate often is fairly neutral and grainy, or can take
on a lightly toasty or biscuity note as it finishes with a light
taste of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to
the finish. A light earthy or floral hop flavor is optional.
Medium to medium-low bitterness. Medium-dry to dry finish.
Clean and smooth. Low esters optional. The balance tends to be
slightly towards the malt, although light use of roasted grains
may increase the perception of bitterness slightly.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body, although
examples containing low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly
slick mouthfeel (not required). Moderate carbonation. Smooth.

<b>Comments:</b> The style is fairly broad to allow for examples
beyond the traditional ones from Ireland. Irish examples tend
to be lower alcohol, grainier, and drier in the finish, while non-
Irish versions are often higher in alcohol, sweeter, perhaps
more caramelly and estery, and are often seasonal offerings.

<b>History:</b> While Ireland has a long ale brewing heritage, the
modern Irish Red Ale style is essentially an adaptation or
interpretation of the popular English Bitter style with less
hopping and a bit of roast to add color and dryness, although
some suggest a longer history. Rediscovered as a craft beer
style in Ireland, today it is an essential part of most brewery
lineups, along with a pale ale and a stout.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Generally has a bit of roasted
barley or black malt to provide reddish color and dry roasted
finish. Pale base malt. Caramel malts were historically
imported and more expensive, so not all brewers would use
them.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> A less-bitter and hoppy Irish equivalent
to an English Bitter, with a dryish finish due to roasted barley.
More attenuated with less caramel flavor and body than
equivalent-strength Scottish Ales.
