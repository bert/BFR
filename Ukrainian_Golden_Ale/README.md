# Ukrainian Golden Ale

Ukrainian golden ale is a local Ukrainian beer style, originating in the Donets'k region in 2009.

The main features distinguishing it from British golden ale and Belgian golden ale are a sweetish
taste and aftertaste, fuller body, more neutral yeast-derived aromatics (in comparison with
Belgian counterparts), less bitterness than in British golden ale; more alcohol than in British
and less than in Belgian style.
Coriander seeds are often used, and beer can be lightly dry-hopped with aroma hops.

## History

The first Ukrainian golden ale was brewed at John Huges Brewery in Donets'k by Dmytro Nekrasov in 2009.
It was inspired by both German (Reinheitsgebot: therefore, no sugar additions) and Belgian brewing
traditions.
The latter was discovered during Dmytro's trip to Belgium, urged by the brewery's owner, Vasyl Mykulin.
With no sugar additions and being 100% malt based, the resulting beer differed from the Belgian
counterparts by being hazy, fuller in body and sweeter, though it was sold as Belgian Ale upon
its inception.

The recipe was heavily influenced by the availability of ingredients too: initially dry S-33 yeast were used,
with subsequent use of the same strain, US 05, or a mix of both.

After the occupation of Donets'k, both Dmytro Nekrasov and Vasyl Mykulin had to flee the city and star
brewing at different breweries, taking the Golden Ale with them.
The style gained a following as a stepping stone for beer lovers, a middle ground between mass-market
beer and new-wave beer, being quite approachable.
Eventually, the style was adopted by a number of breweries.
Independent Brewers of Ukraine approximated that in 2021 Ukrainians consumed 1.25 million liters of
golden ale.

For a while, the beers were labeled as generic "Golden Ale" or "Belgian Ale" because of the lack of
uninterrupted brewing tradition in Ukraine and the persistent perception of foreign beers/styles
to be superior.
