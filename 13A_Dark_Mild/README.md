<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 13 Brown British Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 13A Dark Mild

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A dark, low-gravity, malt-focused
British session ale readily suited to drinking in quantity.
Refreshing, yet flavorful for its strength, with a wide range of
dark malt or dark sugar expression.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to moderate malt aroma, and may have some
fruitiness. The malt expression can take on a wide range of
character, which can include caramel, toffee, grainy, toasted,
nutty, chocolate, or lightly roasted. Low earthy or floral hop
aroma optional. Very low diacetyl optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Copper to dark brown or mahogany color.
Generally clear, although is traditionally unfiltered. Low to
moderate off-white to tan head; retention may be poor.

<b>Flavor:</b> Generally a malty beer, although may have a very wide
range of malt- and yeast-based flavors (e.g., malty, sweet,
caramel, toffee, toast, nutty, chocolate, coffee, roast, fruit,
licorice, plum, raisin) over a bready, biscuity, or toasty base.
Can finish sweet to dry. Versions with darker malts may have a
dry, roasted finish. Low to moderate bitterness, enough to
provide some balance but not enough to overpower the malt in
the balance. Moderate fruity esters optional. Low hop flavor
optional. Low diacetyl optional.

<b>Mouthfeel</b>: Light to medium body. Generally low to medium-
low carbonation. Roast-based versions may have a light
astringency. Sweeter versions may seem to have a rather full
mouthfeel for the gravity. Should not be flat, watery, or thin.

<b>Comments:</b> Most are low-gravity session beers around 3.2%,
although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+)
range for export, festivals, seasonal or special occasions.
Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions
don’t often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are
possible. Pale (medium amber to light brown) versions exist,
but these are even more rare than dark milds; these guidelines
only describe the modern dark version.

<b>History:</b> Historically, ‘mild’ was simply an unaged beer, and
could be used as an adjective to distinguish between aged or
more highly hopped keeping beers. Modern milds trace their
roots to the weaker X-type ales of the 1800s, which started to
get darker in the 1880s, but only after WWI did they become
dark brown. In current usage, the term implies a lower-
strength beer with less hop bitterness than bitters. The
guidelines describe the modern British version. The term ‘mild’
is currently somewhat out of favor with consumers, and many
breweries no longer use it. Increasingly rare. There is no
historic connection or relationship between Mild and Porter.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Some versions may seem like lower-
gravity modern English Porters. Much less sweet than London
Brown Ale.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Pale British base malts (often
fairly dextrinous), crystal malt, dark malts or dark sugar
adjuncts, may also include adjuncts such as flaked maize, and
may be colored with brewer’s caramel. Characterful British ale
yeast. Any type of hops, since their character is muted and
rarely is noticeable.
