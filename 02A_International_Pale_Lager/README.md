<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 02A International Pale Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A highly-attenuated pale lager without
strong flavors, typically well-balanced and highly carbonated.
Served cold, it is refreshing and thirst-quenching.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to medium-low grainy-malty or slightly corny-
sweet malt aroma. Very low to medium spicy, floral, or herbal
hop aroma. Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Appearance:</b> Pale straw to gold color. White, frothy head may
not be long lasting. Very clear.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to moderate levels of grainy-malt flavor,
medium-low to medium bitterness, with a crisp, dry, well-
attenuated finish. The grain character can be somewhat
neutral, or show a light bready-crackery quality. Moderate
corny or malty sweetness optional. Medium floral, spicy, or
herbal hop flavor optional. Balance may vary from slightly
malty to slightly bitter, but is usually relatively close to even.
Neutral aftertaste with light malt and sometimes hop flavors.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Light to medium body. Moderately high to highly
carbonated. Can have a slight carbonic bite on the tongue.

<b>Comments:</b> Tends to have fewer adjuncts than American
Lagers. They may be all-malt, although strong flavors are still a
fault. A broad category of international mass-market lagers
ranging from up-scale American lagers to the typical “import”
or “green bottle” international beers found in America and
many export markets. Often confusingly labeled as a “Pilsner.”
Any skunkiness in commercial beers is a handling fault, not a
characteristic of the style.

<b>History:</b> In the United States, developed as a premium
version of the standard American lager, with a similar history.
Outside the US, developed either as an imitation of American-
style lagers, or as a more accessible (and often drier and less
bitter) version of a Pilsner-type beer. Often heavily marketed
and exported by large industrial or multi-national breweries.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Two- or six-row barley. May
use rice, corn, or sugar as adjuncts, but are generally all malt.
Style Comparison: Generally more bitter and filling than
American Lager. Less hoppy and bitter than a German Pils.
Less body, malt flavor, and hop character than a Czech
Premium Pale Lager. More robust versions can approach a
Munich Helles in flavor, but with more of an adjunct quality.

<b>Entry Instructions:</b> Entrant may specify regional variations,
if desired (Mexican lager, Dutch lager, etc.).
