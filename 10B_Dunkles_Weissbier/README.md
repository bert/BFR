<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 10 German Wheat Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 10B Dunkles Weissbier

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A moderately dark German wheat beer
with a distinctive banana-and-clove weizen yeast fermentation
profile, supported by a toasted bread or caramel malt flavor.
Highly carbonated and refreshing, with a creamy, fluffy texture
and light finish.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate esters and phenols, typically banana and
clove, often well balanced with each other and with the malt.
Light to moderate bready, doughy, or grainy wheat aroma,
often accompanied by caramel, bread crust, or richer malt
notes. Low to moderate vanilla optional. Light floral, spicy, or
herbal hops optional. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana),
sourness, or smoke are faults.

<b>Appearance:</b> Light copper to dark, mahogany brown in color.
Very thick, moussy, long-lasting off-white head. Can be hazy
and have a shine from wheat and yeast, although this can settle
out in bottled versions.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor,
often well balanced with each other and with the malt,
although the malt may sometimes mask the clove impression.
Low to medium-high soft, somewhat bready, doughy, or grainy
wheat flavor with richer caramel, toast, or bread crust flavors.
No strongly roasted flavors, but a touch of roasty dryness is
allowable. Very low to low bitterness. Well-rounded, flavorful,
often somewhat malty palate with a relatively dry finish. Very
light to moderate vanilla optional. Low spicy, herbal, or floral
hop flavor optional. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium-full body. Fluffy,
creamy fullness progressing to a lighter finish, aided by
moderate to high carbonation. Effervescent.

<b>Comments:</b> Often known as dunkelweizen, particularly in the
United States. Increasingly rare and often being replaced by
Kristall and non-alcoholic versions in Germany.

<b>History:</b> Bavaria has a wheat beer brewing traditional
hundreds of years old, but the brewing right was reserved for
Bavarian royalty until the late 1700s. Old-fashioned Bavarian
wheat beer was often dark, as were most beers of the time. Pale
Weissbier started to become popular in the 1960s, but
traditional dark wheat beer remained somewhat of an old
person’s drink.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Malted wheat, at least half the
grist. Munich, Vienna, or Pilsner malt. Dark wheat, caramel
wheat, or color malt. Decoction mash traditional. Weizen yeast,
cool fermentation temperatures.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Combines the yeast and wheat character
of Weissbier with the malty richness of a Munich Dunkel. The
banana-and-clove character is often less apparent than in a
Weissbier due to the increased maltiness. Has a similar yeast
character as Roggenbier, but without the rye flavor and
increased body.
