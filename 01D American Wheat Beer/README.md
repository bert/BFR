<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 1 Standard American Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 01D American Wheat Beer

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A pale, refreshing grainy, doughy, or
bready wheat beer with a clean fermentation profile and a
variable hop character and bitterness. Its lighter body and
higher carbonation contribute to its easy-drinking nature.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to moderate grainy, bready, or doughy wheat
character. A light to moderate malty sweetness is acceptable.
Moderate esters optional, usually a neutral profile; banana is
inappropriate. Low to moderate citrusy, spicy, floral, or fruity
hop aroma. Not typically dry-hopped. No clove phenols.

<b>Appearance:</b> Usually pale yellow to gold. Clarity may range
from brilliant to hazy with yeast approximating a Weissbier.
Big, long-lasting white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Light to moderately-strong bready, doughy, or grainy
wheat flavor, which can linger into the finish. May have a
moderate malty sweetness or can finish quite dry and crisp.
Low to moderate hop bitterness, sometimes lasting into the
finish. Balance is usually even, but may be slightly bitter. Low
to moderate citrusy, spicy, floral, or fruity hop flavor. Moderate
esters optional. No banana. No clove phenols.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Medium-high to
high carbonation. Slight creaminess is optional; wheat beers
sometimes have a soft, ‘fluffy’ impression.

<b>Comments:</b> Different variations exist, from an easy-drinking
fairly sweet beer to a dry, aggressively-hopped beer with a
strong wheat flavor. American Rye beers should be entered as
31A Alternative Grain Beer.

<b>History:</b> An American craft beer adaptation of the Weissbier
style using a cleaner yeast and more hops, first produced by
Anchor in 1984 and later widely popularized by Widmer.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Clean American ale or lager
yeast. German Weissbier yeast is inappropriate. Wheat malt
(often 30–50%, lower than is typical in Weissbier). American,
German, or New World hops.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> More hop character and less yeast
character than Weissbier. Never with the banana and clove
character of Weissbier. Generally has the same range and
balance as Blonde Ales, but with a wheat character as the
primary malt flavor.
