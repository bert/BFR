<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 1 Standard American Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 01C Cream Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A clean, well-attenuated, highly
carbonated, flavorful American “lawnmower” beer. Easily
drinkable, smooth, and refreshing, with more character than
typical American lagers, yet still subtle and restrained.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium-low to low malt notes, with a sweet, corn-
like aroma. Low DMS optional. Medium-low hop aroma
optional, using any variety but floral, spicy, or herbal notes are
most common. Overall, has a subtle, balanced aroma. Low
fruity esters optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Pale straw to light gold color, although usually
on the pale side. Low to medium head with medium to high
carbonation. Fair head retention. Brilliant, sparkling clarity.
Effervescent.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to medium-low hop bitterness. Low to moderate
malty sweetness, varying with gravity and attenuation. The
malt is generally neutral, possibly grainy or crackery. Usually
well-attenuated. Balanced palate, with hops only enough to
support the malt. A low to moderate corny flavor is commonly
found, but light DMS is optional. Finish can vary from
somewhat light, dry, and crisp to faintly sweet. Clean
fermentation profile, but low fruity esters are optional. Low to
medium-low hop flavor of any variety, but typically floral,
spicy, or herbal. Subtle.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Generally light and crisp, although body can
reach medium. Smooth mouthfeel with medium to high
attenuation; higher attenuation levels can lend a “thirst
quenching” quality. High carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> Most commercial examples are in the 1.050–
1.053 OG range, and bitterness rarely rises above 20 IBUs.

<b>History:</b> A sparkling or present-use ale from the second half
of the 1800s that survived prohibition. An ale brewed to
compete with lagers brewed in Canada and the US Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest states.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> American six-row malt, or a
combination of six-row and North American two-row. Up to
20% maize in the mash, and up to 20% sugar in the boil. Any
variety of hops, often rustic American or Continental. Clean ale
yeast, or a mix of ale and lager beer.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Similar to a Standard American Lager,
but with more character. Lighter body, smoother, and more
carbonated than a Blonde Ale. May seem like a somewhat
subtle Kölsch.
