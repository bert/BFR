<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 10 German Wheat Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 10A Weissbier

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A pale, refreshing, lightly-hopped
German wheat beer with high carbonation, dry finish, fluffy
mouthfeel, and a distinctive banana-and-clove weizen yeast
fermentation profile.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to strong esters and phenols, typically
banana and clove, often well balanced and typically stronger
than the malt. Light to moderate bready, doughy, or grainy
wheat aroma. Light vanilla optional. Light floral, spicy, or
herbal hops optional. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana),
sourness, or smoke are faults.

<b>Appearance:</b> Pale straw to gold in color. Very thick, moussy,
long-lasting white head. Can be hazy and have a shine from
wheat and yeast, although this can settle out in bottles.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor,
often well balanced. Low to moderate soft, somewhat bready,
doughy, or grainy wheat flavor supported by the slight Pils malt
grainy sweetness. Very low to moderately low bitterness. Well-
rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. Light
vanilla optional. Very low floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor
optional. Any impression of sweetness is due more to low
bitterness than any residual sweetness; a sweet or heavy finish
impairs drinkability. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults.
While the banana-and-clove profile is important, it should not
be so strong as to be extreme and unbalanced.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body; never heavy.
Fluffy, creamy fullness progressing to a light, spritzy finish
aided by high to very high carbonation. Effervescent.

<b>Comments:</b> Also known as hefeweizen or weizenbier,
particularly outside Bavaria. These beers are best enjoyed while
young and fresh, as they often don’t age well. In Germany,
lower-alcohol light (leicht) and non-alcoholic versions are
popular. Kristall versions are filtered for brilliant clarity.

<b>History:</b> While Bavaria has a wheat beer tradition dating back
before the 1500s, brewing wheat beer used to be a monopoly
reserved for Bavarian royalty. Modern Weissbier dates from
1872 when Schneider began production of its amber version.
However, pale Weissbier only became popular since the 1960s
(although the name historically could be used in Germany to
describe beer made from air-dried malt, a different tradition).
It is quite popular today, particularly in southern Germany.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Malted wheat, at least half the
grist. Pilsner malt. Decoction mash traditional. Weizen yeast,
cool fermentation temperatures.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Compared to American Wheat, has a
banana and clove yeast character and less bitterness.
Compared to a Dunkles Weissbier, has a paler color and less
malt richness and flavor.

<b>Entry Instructions:</b> The entrant may specify whether the
yeast should be roused before serving.
