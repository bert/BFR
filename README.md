## A backup of Brewfather recipes I hoarded over the years.

- Recipes are sorted in folders named by BJCP style.

- All recipes are normalized for 5 Liter batch size (fermenting vessel)
  and can be brewed in a 12 Liter stove pot.

- Most, if not all, recipes can be mashed in a 8 Liter mash tun or pot.

## BJCP Styles

### BJCP Style 1 Standard American Beer

This category describes everyday American beers that have a wide public appeal. Containing both ales and lagers, the beers of this
category are not typically complex, and have smooth, accessible flavors. The ales tend to have lager-like qualities, or are designed to
appeal to mass-market lager drinkers as crossover beers. Mass-market beers with a more international appeal or origin are
described in the International Lager category.
