## A backup of Brewfather recipes I hoarded over the years.

- Recipes are sorted in folders named as per BJCP style, or any other style that's out there.

- Each recipe has its own subfolder containing:
  - a human readable pdf file.
  - a Brewfather native json file.
  - an xml file for exchange to other brewing software.

- All recipes are normalized for 5 Liter batch size (fermenting vessel)
  and can be brewed in a 12 Liter stove pot.

- Most, if not all, recipes can be mashed in a 8 Liter mash tun or pot.
