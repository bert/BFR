## A backup of Brewfather recipes I hoarded over the years.

- Recipes are sorted in folders named by BJCP style.

- All recipes are normalized for 5 Liter batch size (fermenting vessel)
  and can be brewed in a 12 Liter stove pot.

- Most, if not all, recipes can be mashed in a 8 Liter mash tun or pot.
