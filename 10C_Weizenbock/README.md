<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 10 German Wheat Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 10C Weizenbock

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A strong and malty German wheat beer
combining the best wheat and yeast flavors of a Weissbier with
the rich maltiness, strength, and body of a Bock. The style
range includes Bock and Doppelbock strength, with variations
for pale and dark color.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium-high to high malty richness with a
significant bready, grainy wheat character. Medium-low to
medium-high weizen yeast character, typically banana and
clove. Vanilla accents optional. No hops. Low to moderate
alcohol, not hot or solventy. The malt, yeast, and alcohol are
well balanced, complex, and inviting. Bubblegum (strawberry
with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.
Dark versions have a deeper, highly toasted, bready malt
richness with significant Maillard products, similar to a
Dunkles Bock or dark Doppelbock. They can also have caramel
and dark fruit esters, like plums, prunes, dark grapes, fruit
leather, and raisins, particularly as they age.
Pale versions have a grainy-sweet, bready, toasty malty
richness, similar to a Helles Bock or pale Doppelbock.

<b>Appearance:</b> Very thick, moussy, long-lasting head. Can be
hazy and have a shine from wheat and yeast, although this can
settle out with age.
Dark versions are dark amber to dark ruby-brown in color,
with a light tan head.
Pale versions are gold to amber in color, with a very white to
off-white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium-high to high malty richness with significant
bready, grainy wheat flavor. Low to moderate banana and spice
(clove, vanilla) yeast character. No hop flavor. Low to medium-
low bitterness can give a slightly sweet palate impression, but
the beer typically finishes dry. Light alcohol can enhance this
character. The interplay between the malt, yeast, and alcohol
adds complexity and interest, which is often enhanced with
age. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults.
Dark versions have deeper, richly bready or toasty malt flavors
with significant Maillard products, optionally with caramel or
light chocolate but not roast. Can have some dark fruit esters
like plums, prunes, dark grapes, fruit leather, or raisins,
particularly as they age.
Pale versions have a bready, toasty, grainy-sweet malt richness.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to full body. Soft, smooth, fluffy or
creamy texture. Mild alcohol warmth. Moderate to high
carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> A Weissbier brewed to bock or doppelbock
strength, although Schneider also produces an Eisbock version.
Pale and dark versions exist, but dark is most common. Lightly
oxidized Maillard products can produce some rich, intense
flavors and aromas that are often seen in aged imported
commercial products; fresher versions will not have this
character. Well-aged examples might also take on a slight
sherry-like complexity. Pale versions, like their doppelbock
cousins, have less rich malt complexity and often more hop-
forward. However, versions that have significant late hops or
are dry-hopped should be entered in 34B Mixed-Style Beer.

<b>History:</b> Dopplebock-strength Aventinus was created in 1907
at the Schneider Weisse Brauhaus in Munich. Pale versions are
a much more recent invention.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Malted wheat, at least half the
grist. Munich, Vienna, or Pilsner malt. Color malts may be used
sparingly. Decoction mash traditional. Weizen yeast, cool
fermentation temperatures.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Stronger and richer than a Weissbier or
Dunkles Weissbier, but with similar yeast character. More
directly comparable to the Doppelbock style, with the pale and
dark variations. Can vary widely in strength, but most are in
the Bock to Doppelbock range.

<b>Entry Instructions:</b> The entrant will specify whether the
entry is a pale (SRM 6-9) or a dark (SRM 10-25) version.
