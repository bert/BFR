<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 17 Strong British Ale

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 17C Wee Heavy

<b>Overall Impression:</b> Rich, sweet malt depth with caramel,
toffee, and fruity flavors. Full-bodied and chewy, with warming
alcohol. Restrained bitterness, but not cloying or syrupy.

<b>Aroma:</b> Strong bready-toasty malt, with a high caramel and
toffee aspect. A wide range of supportive caramelized sugar and
toasty bread type aromas are possible (toasted breadcrumbs,
ladyfingers, English biscuits, graham crackers, nougat,
butterscotch, etc.). Faint hint of roast is sometimes noted. Low
to moderate dark or dried fruit esters and alcohol. Very low
earthy, floral, orange-citrus, or spicy hops optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Light copper to dark brown color, often with
deep ruby highlights. Clear. Usually has a large tan head, which
may not persist. Legs may be evident in stronger versions.

<b>Flavor:</b> Rich, bready-toasty malt that is often full and sweet
on the palate with caramel and toffee flavors, but balanced by
alcohol and a hint of grainy roast in the finish. The malt often
has caramelized sugar and toasty flavors of the same type as
described in the aroma. Medium to low alcohol and esters
(plums, raisins, dried fruit, etc.). Bitterness low in the balance,
giving a sweet to medium-dry finish. Medium-low hop flavor
optional, with similar descriptors as the aroma.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to full-bodied, sometimes with a
thick, chewy, sometimes creamy, viscosity. A smooth alcohol
warmth is usually present and is desirable since it balances the
malty sweetness. Moderate carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> A range of strengths is allowable; not all versions
are very strong. Also known as “Strong Scotch Ale,” the term
“wee heavy” means “small strong” and traces to the beer that
made the term famous, Fowler’s Wee Heavy, a 12 Guinea Ale.

<b>History:</b> Descended from Edinburgh Ales, a stronger malty
beer brewed in a range of strengths, similar to Burton Ale
(although at half the hopping rate). Modern versions have two
main variants, a more modest 5% ABV beer and the more
widely known 8-9% ABV beer. As gravities decreased over
times, some of the variations ceased to be produced.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Scottish pale ale malt, a wide
range of other ingredients are possible, including adjuncts.
Some may use crystal malt or darker grains for color. No peat-
smoked malt.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Somewhat similar to an English Barley
Wine, but often darker and more caramelly.
