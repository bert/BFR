<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 12 Pale Commonwealth Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 12B Australian Sparkling Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A well-balanced, pale, highly-
carbonated, and refreshing ale suitable for drinking in a hot
climate. Fairly bitter, with a moderate herbal-spicy hop and
pome fruit ester profile. Smooth, neutral malt flavors with a
fuller body but a crisp, highly-attenuated finish.

<b>Aroma:</b> Fairly soft, clean aroma with a balanced mix of esters,
hops, malt, and yeast – all moderate to low in intensity. The
esters are frequently pears and apples, optionally with a very
light touch of banana. The hops are earthy, herbaceous, or
might show the characteristic iron-like Pride of Ringwood
nose. The malt can range from neutral grainy to moderately
sweet to lightly bready; no caramel should be evident. Very
fresh examples can have a lightly yeasty, sulfury nose.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep yellow to light amber in color, often
medium gold. Tall, frothy, persistent white head with tiny
bubbles. Noticeable effervescence due to high carbonation.
Brilliant clarity if decanted, but typically poured with yeast to
have a cloudy appearance. Not typically cloudy unless yeast
roused during the pour.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to low rounded, grainy to bready malt flavor,
initially mild to malty-sweet but a medium to medium-high
bitterness rises mid-palate to balance the malt. Caramel flavors
typically absent. Highly attenuated, giving a dry, crisp finish
with lingering bitterness, although the body gives an
impression of fullness. Medium to medium-high hop flavor,
somewhat earthy and possibly herbal, resinous, peppery, or
iron-like but not floral, lasting into aftertaste. Medium-high to
medium-low esters, often pears and apples. Banana is optional,
but should never dominate. May be lightly minerally or sulfury,
especially if yeast is present. Should not be bland.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> High to very high carbonation, giving mouth-
filling bubbles and a crisp, spritzy carbonic bite. Medium to
medium-full body, tending to the higher side if poured with
yeast. Smooth but gassy. Stronger versions may have a light
alcohol warmth, but lower alcohol versions will not. Very well-
attenuated; should not have any residual sweetness.

<b>Comments:</b> Coopers has been making their flagship
Sparkling Ale since 1862, although the formulation has
changed over the years. Presently the beer will have brilliant
clarity if decanted, but publicans often pour most of the beer
into a glass then swirl the bottle and dump in all the yeast. In
some bars, the bottle is rolled along the bar. When served on
draught, the brewery instructs publicans to invert the keg to
rouse the yeast. A cloudy appearance for the style seems to be a
modern consumer preference. Always naturally carbonated,
even in the keg. A present-use ale, best enjoyed fresh.

<b>History:</b> Brewing records show that the majority of Australian
beer brewed in the 19 th century was draught XXX (Mild) and
porter. Ale in bottle was originally developed to compete with
imported bottled pale ales from British breweries, such as Bass
and Wm Younger’ Monk. By the early 20 th century, bottled pale
ale went out of fashion and “lighter” lager beers were in vogue.
Many Australian Sparkling and Pale Ales were labeled as ales,
but were actually bottom-fermented lagers with very similar
grists to the ales that they replaced. Coopers of Adelaide, South
Australia is the only surviving brewer producing the Sparkling
Ale style.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Lightly kilned Australian 2-row
pale malt, lager varieties may be used. Small amounts of crystal
malt for color adjustment only. Modern examples use no
adjuncts, cane sugar for priming only. Historical examples
using 45% 2 row, 30% higher protein malt (6 row) would use
around 25% sugar to dilute the nitrogen content. Traditionally
used Australian hops, Cluster, and Goldings until replaced
from mid-1960s by Pride of Ringwood. Highly attenuative
Burton-type yeast (Australian-type strain typical). Variable
water profile, typically with low carbonate and moderate
sulfate.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Superficially similar to English Pale Ales,
although much more highly carbonated, with less caramel, less
late hops, and showcasing the signature yeast strain and hop
variety. More bitter than IBUs might suggest due to high
attenuation, low final gravity, and somewhat coarse hops.
