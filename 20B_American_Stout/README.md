<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 20 American Porter and Stout

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 20B American Stout

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A fairly strong, highly roasted, bitter,
hoppy dark stout. The body and dark flavors typical of stouts
with a more aggressive American hop character and bitterness.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to strong roast aroma, often with a roasted
coffee or dark chocolate quality. Burnt or charcoal aromas are
acceptable at low levels. Medium to very low hop aroma, often
with a citrusy or resiny character. Medium esters optional.
Light alcohol optional. Should not seem sharp, acrid, or acidic.

<b>Appearance:</b> Generally a jet black color, although some may
appear very dark brown. Large, persistent head of light tan to
light brown in color. Usually opaque.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate to very high roasted flavors, often tasting of
coffee, dark or bittersweet chocolate, or roasted coffee beans.
May taste of slightly burnt coffee grounds, but this character
should not be prominent. Low to medium malt sweetness,
often with rich chocolate or caramel flavors. Medium to high
bitterness. Low to high hop flavor, generally citrusy or resiny.
Medium to dry finish, occasionally with a lightly burnt quality.
Low esters optional. Light but smooth alcohol flavor optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to full body. Can be somewhat creamy.
Can have a bit of roast-derived astringency, but this character
should not be excessive. Medium-high to high carbonation.
Light to moderately strong alcohol warmth, but smooth and
not excessively hot.

<b>Comments:</b> Breweries express individuality through varying
the roasted malt profile, malt sweetness and flavor, and the
amount of finishing hops used. Generally has bolder roasted
malt flavors and hopping than other traditional stouts (except
Imperial Stouts). Becoming increasingly hard to find.

<b>History:</b> A modern craft beer and homebrew style that applied
a more aggressive American hopping regime to a strong
traditional English or Irish Stout. The homebrew version was
once known as West Coast Stout, a common naming scheme
for a more highly-hopped beer.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Common American base malts,
yeast, and hops. Varied use of dark and roasted malts, as well
as caramel-type malts. Adjuncts or additives may be present in
low quantities to add complexity.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Like a hoppy, bitter, strongly roasted
Irish Extra Stout. Much more roast and body than a Black IPA.
Bigger, stronger versions belong in the Imperial Stout style.
Stronger and more assertive, particularly in the dark malt or
grain additions and hop character, than American Porter.
