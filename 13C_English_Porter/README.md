<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 13 Brown British Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 13C English Porter

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A moderate-strength dark brown
English ale with a restrained roasty, bitter character. May have
a range of roasted flavors, generally without burnt qualities,
and often has a malty chocolate and caramel profile.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to moderately low bready, biscuity, and
toasty malt aroma with mild roastiness, often like chocolate.
Additional malt complexity may be present as caramel, nuts,
toffee sweetness. May have up to a moderate level of floral or
earthy hops. Moderate fruity esters optional, but desirable.
Low diacetyl optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Brown to dark brown in color, often with ruby
highlights. Good clarity, although may be opaque. Moderate
off-white to light tan head with good to fair retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate bready, biscuity, and toasty malt flavor with
a mild to moderate chocolate roastiness, and often a significant
caramel, nutty, or toffee character, possibly with lower levels of
darker flavors like coffee or licorice. Should not be burnt or
harshly roasted, although small amounts may contribute a
bitter chocolate complexity. Up to moderate earthy or floral
hop flavor optional. Low to moderate fruity esters. Medium-
low to medium bitterness varies the balance from slightly malty
to slightly bitter, with a fairly dry to slightly sweet finish.
Moderately-low diacetyl optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Moderately-low
to moderately-high carbonation. Light to moderate creamy
texture.

<b>Comments:</b> This style description describes the modern
version of English Porter, not every possible variation over
time in every region where it existed. Historical re-creations
should be entered in the 27 Historical Beer category, with an
appropriate description describing the profile of the beer.
Modern craft examples in the UK are bigger and hoppier.

<b>History:</b> Originating in London in the early 1700s, porter
evolved as a more heavily hopped and aged (keeping) version
of the Brown Beer popular at the time. It evolved many times
based on various technological and ingredient developments
(such as the invention of black malt in 1817, and large-scale
industrial brewing), as well as consumer preferences, wars, and
tax policy. It became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in
the early 1800s before declining by the 1870s as it changed to a
lower gravity, unaged beer. As gravities continued to decline in
all UK beers in the first half of the 1900s, styles stopped being
made (including porter, gone by the 1950s). The craft beer era
led to its re-introduction in 1978.
The name is said to have been derived from its popularity with
the London working class performing various load-carrying
tasks of the day. Parent of various regional interpretations over
time, and a predecessor to all stouts (which were originally
called “stout porters”). There is no historic connection or
relationship between Mild and Porter.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Grists vary, but something
producing a dark color is always involved. Chocolate or other
roasted malts, caramel malt, brewing sugars, and the like are
common. London-type porters often use brown malt as a
characteristic flavor.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Differs from American Porter in that it
usually has softer, sweeter, and more caramelly flavors, lower
gravities, and usually less alcohol; American Porter also usually
has more hop character. More substance and roast than a
British Brown Ale. Higher in gravity than a Dark Mild.
