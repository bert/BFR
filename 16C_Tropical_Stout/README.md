<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 16 Dark British Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 16C Tropical Stout

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A very dark, sweet, fruity, moderately
strong stout with smooth, roasty flavors, yet no burnt
harshness.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to high intensity sweetness is prominent.
Moderate to high coffee or chocolate roasty aroma, but not
burnt. Medium to high fruitiness. May have a molasses,
licorice, burnt sugar, dried fruit, or vinous aromatics. Stronger
versions can have a subtle, clean aroma of alcohol. Low hop
aroma optional. Low diacetyl optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Very deep brown to black in color. Clarity
usually obscured by deep color. Clear, if not opaque. Large tan
to brown head with good retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Quite sweet with a smooth dark grain flavors, and
restrained, medium-low to medium bitterness. Smooth, roasty
flavor, often like coffee or chocolate, although moderated in the
balance by the sweet finish. No burnt malt flavor or harsh bite
in the finish. Moderate to high fruity esters. Can have a sweet,
dark rum, molasses, or burnt sugar-like quality. Low hop flavor
optional. Medium-low diacetyl optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to full body, often with a smooth,
creamy character. May have a warming but not hot alcohol
presence. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> Surprisingly refreshing in a hot climate.
Sweetness levels can vary significantly. Tropical implies that
the beer originated in and is popular in the tropics, not that it
has characteristics of tropical fruit from hops or fruit.

<b>History:</b> A local adaptation of Foreign Extra Stouts brewed
with indigenous ingredients and methods in the Caribbean and
other tropical markets. Bitterness lower than export-type
stouts since these beers do not have to be shipped abroad, and
to suit local palate preferences.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Similar to a Sweet Stout, but
higher gravity. Pale and dark roasted malts and grains. Hops
mostly for bitterness. May use adjuncts and sugar to boost
gravity. Typically made with warm-fermented lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Tastes like a scaled-up Sweet Stout with
higher fruitiness. Similar to some Imperial Stouts without the
high bitterness, strong or burnt roastiness, and late hops, and
with lower alcohol. Much sweeter and less hoppy than
American Stouts. Much sweeter and less bitter than the
similar-gravity Foreign Extra Stouts.
