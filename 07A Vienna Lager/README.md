<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 7 Amber Bitter European Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 07A Vienna Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A moderate-strength continental
amber lager with a soft, smooth maltiness and a balanced,
moderate bitterness, yet finishing relatively dry. The malt
flavor is clean, bready-rich, and somewhat toasty, with an
elegant impression derived from quality base malts and
process, not specialty malts or adjuncts.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderately-intense malt aroma, with toasty and
malty-rich accents. Floral, spicy hop aroma may be low to
none. Clean lager character. A significant caramel, biscuity, or
roasted aroma is inappropriate.

<b>Appearance:</b> Light reddish amber to copper color. Bright
clarity. Large, off-white, persistent head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Soft, elegant malt complexity is in the forefront, with a
firm enough hop bitterness to provide a balanced finish. The
malt flavor tends towards a rich, toasty character, without
significant caramel, biscuity, or roast flavors. Fairly dry, soft
finish, with both rich malt and hop bitterness present in the
aftertaste. Floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor may be low to
none. Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body, with a gentle
creaminess. Moderate carbonation. Smooth.

<b>Comments:</b> A standard-strength everyday beer, not a beer
brewed for festivals. Many traditional examples have become
sweeter and more adjunct-laden, now seeming more like
International Amber or Dark Lagers.

<b>History:</b> Developed by Anton Dreher in Vienna in 1841,
became popular in the mid-late 1800s. The style was brought
to Mexico by Santiago Graf and other Austrian immigrant
brewers in the late 1800s. Seems to be embraced as a modern
craft style in other countries.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Traditionally, best-quality
Vienna malt, but can also use Pils and Munich malts.
Traditional continental hops. Clean German lager yeast. May
use small amounts of specialty malts for color and sweetness.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Similar malt flavor as a Märzen, but
lighter in intensity, and body, with a touch more bitterness and
dryness in the balance. Lower in alcohol than Märzen or
Festbier. Less rich, malty, and hoppy than Czech Amber Lager.
