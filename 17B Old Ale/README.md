<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 17 Strong British Ale

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 17B Old Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A stronger-than-average English ale,
though usually not as strong or rich as an English Barley Wine,
but usually malty. Warming. Shows positive maturation effects
of a well-kept, aged beer.

<b>Aroma:</b> Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex
blend of dried fruit, vinous, caramel, molasses, toffee, light
treacle, or other specialty malt aromas. Some alcohol and nutty
oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those found in Sherry,
Port, or Madeira. Hop aroma not usually present.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep amber to very dark reddish-brown color,
but most are fairly dark. Age and oxidation may darken the
beer further. Clear, but can be almost opaque. Moderate to low
cream- to light tan-colored head; retention average to poor.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to high malt character with a luscious malt
complexity, often with nut, caramel, or molasses-like flavors.
Light chocolate or roasted malt flavors are optional, but should
never be prominent. Balance is often malty-sweet, but may be
well hopped; the impression of bitterness often depends on
amount of aging. Moderate to high fruity esters are common,
and may take on a dried-fruit or vinous character. The finish
may vary from dry to somewhat sweet. Extended aging may
contribute oxidative flavors similar to a fine old Sherry, Port, or
Madeira. Alcoholic strength should be evident, though not
overwhelming. Low diacetyl optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to full, chewy body, although older
examples may be lower in body due to continued attenuation
during conditioning. Alcohol warmth is often evident and
always welcome. Low to moderate carbonation, depending on
age and conditioning. Light acidity may be present, as well as
some tannin if wood-aged; both are optional.

<b>Comments:</b> Strength and character vary widely. The
predominant defining quality for this style is the impression of
age, which can manifest itself in different ways (complexity,
oxidation, leather, vinous qualities, etc.). Many of these
qualities are otherwise faults, but if the resulting character of
the beer is pleasantly drinkable and complex, then those
characteristics are acceptable. In no way should those
allowable characteristics be interpreted as making an
undrinkably off-flavored beer as somehow in style. Old Peculier
is a well-known but fairly unique beer that is quite different
than other Old Ales.

<b>History:</b> Historically, an aged ale used as stock ales for
blending or enjoyed at full strength (stale or stock refers to
beers that were aged or stored for a significant period of time).
There are at least two definite types in Britain today, weaker,
unaged draught ones that are similar to milds of around 4.5%,
and stronger aged ones that are often 6-8% or more.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Composition varies, although
generally similar to British Strong Ales. The age character is
the biggest driver of the final style profile, which is more
handling than brewing.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Roughly overlapping the British Strong
Ale and the lower end of the English Barley Wine styles, but
always having an aged quality. The distinction between an Old
Ale and a Barley Wine is somewhat arbitrary above 7% ABV,
and generally means having a more significant aged quality.
