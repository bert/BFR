## BJCP Categories and Styles

### BJCP Category 1 Standard American Beer

This category describes everyday American beers that have a wide public appeal. Containing both ales and lagers, the beers of this
category are not typically complex, and have smooth, accessible flavors. The ales tend to have lager-like qualities, or are designed to
appeal to mass-market lager drinkers as crossover beers. Mass-market beers with a more international appeal or origin are
described in the International Lager category.

BJCP Styles:
- 01A American Light Lager
- 01B American Light Lager
- 01C Cream Ale
- 01D American Wheat Beer

### BJCP Category 2 International Lager

International lagers are the premium, industrial, mass-market lagers produced in most countries in the world. Whether developed
from American or European styles, they all tend to have a fairly uniform character and are heavily marketed. Loosely derived from
original Pilsner-type lagers, with colored variations having additional malt flavors while retaining a broad appeal. In many
countries, the styles will be referred to by their local country names. The use of the term “international” doesn’t mean that any beers
are actually labeled as such, but is more of a categorization of similar beers produced worldwide.

BJCP Styles:
- 02A International Pale Lager
- 02B International Amber Lager
- 02C International Dark Lager
