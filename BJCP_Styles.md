## BJCP Styles

### BJCP Style 1 Standard American Beer

This category describes everyday American beers that have a wide public appeal. Containing both ales and lagers, the beers of this
category are not typically complex, and have smooth, accessible flavors. The ales tend to have lager-like qualities, or are designed to
appeal to mass-market lager drinkers as crossover beers. Mass-market beers with a more international appeal or origin are
described in the International Lager category.
