<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 5 Pale Bitter European Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 05C German Helles Exportbier

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A golden German lager balancing a
smooth malty profile with a bitter, hoppy character in a slightly
above-average body and strength beer.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium-low to medium floral, spicy, or herbal hop
aroma. Moderate grainy-sweet malt aroma, possibly with light
toasty, bready, or doughy notes. Clean fermentation profile.
Hops and malt both noticeable, and generally balanced.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium yellow to deep gold. Clear. Persistent
white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate, balanced malt and hops with supporting
bitterness. Malt and hop flavors similar to aroma (same
descriptors and intensities). Medium, noticeable bitterness, full
on the palate, with a medium-dry finish. Clean fermentation
character. Aftertaste of both malt and hops, generally in
balance. Mineral character typically perceived more as a
roundness and fullness of flavor, and a dry, flinty sharpness in
the finish rather than overt mineral flavors. Background sulfate
optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-full body. Medium
carbonation. Smooth and mellow on the palate. Very slight
warmth may be noted in stronger versions.

<b>Comments:</b> Also known Dortmunder Export, Dortmunder,
Export, or simply a Dort. Called Export within Germany, and
often Dortmunder elsewhere, Export is also a beer strength
descriptor under German brewing tradition, and could be
applied to other styles. Splits the difference between a German
Pils and a Munich Helles in several aspects: color, hop-malt
balance, finish, bitterness.

<b>History:</b> Developed in Dortmund in the Ruhr industrial
region in the 1870s in response to pale Pilsner-type beers. It
became very popular after World War II but declined in the
1970s. Other Export-class beers developed independently, and
reflected a slightly stronger version of existing beers.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Minerally water with high
levels of sulfates, carbonates, and chlorides. Traditional
German or Czech hops. Pilsner malt. German lager yeast.
Decoction mash traditional.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Less finishing hops and more body than
a German Pils. More bitter and drier than a Munich Helles.
Stronger, drier, but less hoppy than a Czech Premium Pale
Lager.
