<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 5 Pale Bitter European Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 05A German Leichtbier

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A pale, highly-attenuated, light-bodied
German lager with lower alcohol and calories than standard-
strength beers. Moderately bitter with noticeable malt and hop
flavors, the beer is still interesting to drink.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to medium hop aroma, with a spicy, herbal, or
floral character. Low to medium-low grainy-sweet or slightly
crackery malt aroma. Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Appearance:</b> Pale straw to deep yellow in color. Brilliant
clarity. Moderate white head with average to below average
persistence.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to medium grainy-sweet malt flavor initially.
Medium hop bitterness. Low to medium hop flavor, with a
spicy, herbal, or floral quality. Clean fermentation character,
well-lagered. Dry finish with a light malty and hoppy aftertaste.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Light to very light body. Medium to high
carbonation. Smooth, well-attenuated.

<b>Comments:</b> Marketed primarily as a diet-oriented beer with
lower carbohydrates, alcohol, and calories. Pronounced
“LYESHT-beer.” May also be known as a Diat Pils or Helles,
this style is in the schankbier gravity class. Other variations of
Leicht class beers can be made from Weissbier, Kölsch, and
Altbier; those beers are best entered as 34B Mixed-Style Beer.

<b>History:</b> Traditional versions existed as drinks for physical
laborers in factories or fields, but modern versions are more
based on popular American products in the same class and
targeted towards health or fitness conscious consumers.
Increasingly supplanted in the current market by non-alcoholic
beers and radlers.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Continental Pils malt. German
lager yeast. Traditional German hops.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Like a lower-alcohol, lighter-bodied,
slightly less aggressive German Pils or Munich Helles. More
bitter and flavorful than an American Light Lager.
