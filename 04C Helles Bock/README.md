<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 4 Pale Malty European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 04C Helles Bock

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A relatively pale, strong, malty German
lager with a nicely attenuated finish that enhances drinkability.
The hop character is generally more apparent and the malt
character less deeply rich than in other Bocks.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to strong grainy-sweet malt aroma, often
with a lightly toasted quality and low Maillard products.
Moderately-low spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma optional.
Clean fermentation profile. Low fruity esters optional. Very
light alcohol optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep gold to light amber in color. Bright to
clear clarity. Large, creamy, persistent, white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderately to moderately strong grainy-sweet,
doughy, bready, or lightly toasty malt flavor dominates with
some rich Maillard products providing added interest. Few
caramel flavors optional. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, floral,
peppery hop flavor optional, but present in the best examples.
Moderate hop bitterness, more so in the balance than in other
Bocks. Clean fermentation profile. Well-attenuated, not
cloying, with a moderately-dry finish that may taste of both
malt and hops.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-bodied. Moderate to moderately-high
carbonation. Smooth and clean with no harshness or
astringency, despite the increased hop bitterness. Light alcohol
warming optional.

<b>Comments:</b> Also known as Maibock. Compared to darker
Bock beers, the hops compensate for the lower level of Maillard
products in the balance.

<b>History:</b> A fairly recent development in comparison to the
other members of the bock family. The serving of Maibock is a
seasonal offering associated with springtime and the month of
May, and may include a wider color and hopping range than is
seen in exported products.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> A mix of Pils, Vienna, and
Munich malts. No adjuncts. Light use of pale crystal type malts
possible. Traditional German hops. Clean lager yeast.
Decoction mash is traditional, but boiling is less than in
Dunkles Bock to restrain color development. Soft water.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Can be thought of as either a pale version
of a Dunkles Bock, or a Munich Helles or Festbier brewed to
bock strength. While quite malty, this beer typically has less
dark and rich malt flavors, and can be drier, hoppier, and more
bitter than a Dunkles Bock. Less strong than a pale
Doppelbock, but with similar flavors.
