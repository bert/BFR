<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 5 Pale Bitter European Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 05D German Pils

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A pale, dry, bitter German lager
featuring a prominent hop aroma. Crisp, clean, and refreshing,
showing a brilliant gold color with excellent head retention.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderately to moderately-high flowery, spicy, or
herbal hops. Low to medium grainy, sweet, or doughy malt
character, often with a light honey and toasted cracker quality.
Clean fermentation profile. The hops should be forward, but
not totally dominate the malt in the balance.

<b>Appearance:</b> Straw to deep yellow, brilliant to very clear,
with a creamy, long-lasting white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Initial malt flavor quickly overcome with hop flavor
and bitterness, leading into a dry, crisp finish. Malt and hop
flavors similar to aroma (same descriptors and intensities).
Medium to high bitterness, lingering into the aftertaste along
with a touch of malt and hops. Clean fermentation profile.
Minerally water can accentuate and lengthen the dry finish.
Hops and malt can fade with age, but the beer should always
have a bitter balance.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light body. Medium to high carbonation.
Should not feel heavy. Not harsh, but may have a flinty,
minerally, sharpness in some examples.

<b>Comments:</b> Modern examples of Pils tend to become paler in
color, drier and sharper in finish, and more bitter moving from
South to North in Germany, often mirroring increasing sulfates
in the water. Pils found in Bavaria tend to be a bit softer in
bitterness with more malt flavor and late hop character, yet still
with sufficient hops and crispness of finish to differentiate
itself from Munich Helles. The use of the term ‘Pils’ is more
common in Germany than ‘Pilsner’ to differentiate it from the
Czech style, and (some say) to show respect.

<b>History:</b> Adapted from Czech Pilsner to suit brewing
conditions in Germany, particularly water with higher mineral
content and domestic hop varieties. First brewed in Germany
in the early 1870s. Became more popular after WWII as
German brewing schools emphasized modern techniques.
Along with its cousin Czech Pilsner, it is the ancestor of the
most widely produced beer styles today.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Continental Pilsner malt.
Traditional German hops. Clean German lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Lighter in body and color, drier, crisper,
more fully attenuated, more lingering bitterness, and higher
carbonation than a Czech Premium Pale Lager. More hop
character, malt flavor, and bitterness than International Pale
Lager. More hop character and bitterness with a drier, crisper
finish than a Munich Helles; the Helles has more malt
intensity, but of the same character as the German Pils.
