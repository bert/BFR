<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 03B Czech Premium Pale Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A refreshing pale Czech lager with
considerable malt and hop character and a long finish. The
malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer. The bitterness
is strong and clean but lacks harshness, which gives a well-
balanced, rounded flavor impression that enhances
drinkability.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium to medium-high bready-rich malt and
medium-low to medium-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop
bouquet; though the balance between the malt and hops may
vary, the interplay is rich and complex. Light diacetyl, or very
low fruity esters are optional. Esters tend to increase with
gravity.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium yellow to deep gold color. Brilliant to
very clear clarity. Dense, long-lasting, creamy white head.
Flavor: Rich, complex, bready maltiness combined with a
pronounced yet soft and rounded bitterness and floral and
spicy hop flavor. Malt and hop flavors are medium to medium-
high, and the malt may contain a slight impression of caramel.
Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. The long finish can be
balanced towards hops or malt but is never aggressively tilted
either way. Light to moderately-low diacetyl and low hop-
derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> Generally a group of pivo Plzeňského typu, or
Pilsner-type beers. This style is a combination of the Czech
styles světlý ležák (11–12.9 °P) and světlé speciální pivo (13–
14.9 °P). In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell and
Gambrinus are called Pilsner, despite how widely adopted this
name is worldwide. Outside the Czech Republic, Czech Pilsner
or Bohemian Pilsner are sometimes used to differentiate the
beer from other Pilsner-type beers.
Kvasnicové (“yeast beer”) versions are popular in the Czech
Republic, and may be either kräusened with yeasted wort or
given a fresh dose of pure yeast after fermentation. These beers
are sometimes cloudy, with subtle yeastiness and enhanced
hop character. Modern examples vary in their malt to hop
balance and many are not as hop-forward as Pilsner Urquell.

<b>History:</b> Commonly associated with Pilsner Urquell, which
was first brewed in 1842 after construction of a new brewhouse
by burghers dissatisfied with the standard of beer brewed in
Plzeň. Bavarian brewer Josef Groll is credited with first
brewing the beer, although there may have been earlier pale
lagers in Bohemia. Just as important as the lager yeast was the
use of English malting techniques.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Traditional Czech hops. Czech
malt. Czech lager yeast. Water low in sulfate and carbonate
provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high
hopping rates. The bitterness level of some larger commercial
examples has dropped in recent years, although not as much as
in many contemporary German examples.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> More color, malt richness, and body than
a German Pils, with a fuller finish and a cleaner, softer
impression. Stronger than a Czech Pale Lager.
