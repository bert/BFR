<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 21 IPA

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 21B Specialty IPA

<b>Specialty IPA</b> is a competition entry category, not a distinct
style. Beers entered here are not experimental beers; they are
a collection of currently-produced types of beer that may or
may not have any market longevity. This category also allows
for expansion, so potential future IPA variants (St. Patrick’s
Day Green IPA, Romulan Blue IPA, Zima Clear IPA, etc.) have
a place to be entered without rewriting the style guidelines.
The only common element is that they have the balance and
overall impression of an IPA (typically, an American IPA) but
with some minor tweak.
The term ‘IPA’ is used as a singular descriptor of a type of
hoppy, bitter beer. It is not meant to be spelled out as ‘India
Pale Ale’ when used in the context of a Specialty IPA. None of
these beers ever historically went to India, and many aren’t
pale. But the craft beer market knows what to expect in
balance when a beer is described as an ‘IPA’ – so the modifiers
used to differentiate them are based on that concept alone.
The Specialty IPA category is not intended for Classic-style
IPAs with added ingredients (such as fruit, spice, wood,
smoke, grains, or sugars) – these should be entered in the
appropriate Specialty-Type beer category (Fruit Beer, SHV
Beer, etc.). The Specialty IPA styles are considered Classic
Styles for entering in Specialty-Type category purposes.
Classic-style IPAs with unique or special hops should still be
entered in the appropriate Classic-style IPA style.
Overall Impression: Recognizable as an IPA by balance – a
hop-forward, bitter, dryish beer – with something else present
to distinguish it from the standard categories. Should have
good drinkability, regardless of the form. Excessive harshness
and heaviness are typically faults, as are strong flavor clashes
between the hops and the other specialty ingredients.
Aroma: Detectable hop aroma is required; characterization of
hops is dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA. Other
aromatics may be present; hop aroma is typically the strongest
element.

<b>Appearance:</b> Color depends on specific type of Specialty IPA.
Most should be clear, but a slight haze is acceptable in most
styles. Darker types can be opaque, making clarity irrelevant.
Good, persistent head stand with color dependent on the
specific type of Specialty IPA.

<b>Flavor:</b> Variable by type, with the quality of each component
dependent on the specific Specialty IPA. Hop flavor typically
medium-low to high. Hop bitterness typically medium-high to
very high. Malt flavor generally low to medium. Commonly has
a medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be
noted in stronger versions. Various types of Specialty IPAs can
show additional malt and yeast characteristics, depending on
the type.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Smooth. Medium-light to medium body. Medium
carbonation, generally. A background alcohol warmth can be
perceived in stronger versions.

<b>Comments:</b> Entrants may use this category for a different
strength version of an IPA defined by its own BJCP
subcategory (e.g., session-strength American or English IPA) –
except where an existing BJCP subcategory already exists for
that style (e.g., double [American] IPA). A Session IPA is a 21B
Specialty IPA with a base style of 21A American IPA with
Session strength. A Double IPA is Category 22A not 21B.

<b>Entry Instructions:</b> Entrant <u>must</u> specify a <b>strength</b>
(session, standard, double); if no strength is specified, standard
will be assumed. Entrant __must__ specify specific <b>type</b> of
Specialty IPA from the list of Currently Defined Types
identified in the Style Guidelines, or as amended by Provisional
Styles on the BJCP website; OR the entrant must describe the
type of Specialty IPA and its key characteristics in comment
form so judges will know what to expect.
Entrants <u>may</u> specify specific <b>hop varieties</b> used, if entrants
feel that judges may not recognize the varietal characteristics of
newer hops. Entrants may specify a combination of defined
IPA types (e.g., Black Rye IPA) without providing additional
descriptions.
Currently Defined Types: Belgian IPA, Black IPA, Brown
IPA, Red IPA, Rye IPA, White IPA, Brut IPA
