<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 16 Dark British Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 16D Foreign Extra Stout

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A very dark, rich, moderately strong,
fairly dry stout with prominent roast flavors.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to high roast, like coffee, dark chocolate, or
lightly burnt grain. Low to medium fruitiness. May have a
sweet aroma, or molasses, licorice, dried fruit, or vinous
aromatics. Stronger versions can have a subtle, clean aroma of
alcohol. Low earthy, herbal, or floral hop aroma optional. Low
diacetyl optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Very deep brown to black in color. Clarity
usually obscured by deep color. Clear, if not opaque. Large tan
to brown head with good retention.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate to high roast, like coffee, dark chocolate, or
lightly burnt grain, although without a sharp bite. Low to
medium esters. Medium to high bitterness. Moderately dry
finish. Moderate earthy, herbal, or floral hop flavor optional.
Medium-low diacetyl optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to full body, often with a smooth,
sometimes creamy character. May have a warming but not hot
alcohol presence. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> Also known as Foreign Stout, Export Stout, and
Foreign Export Stout. Historic versions (before WWI, at least)
had the same OG as domestic Extra Stouts, but depending on
the brewery could have had a higher ABV because it had a long
secondary with Brett chewing away at it. The difference
between domestic and foreign versions were the hopping and
length of maturation.

<b>History:</b> Stronger stouts brewed for the export market today,
but with a history stretching back to the 18 th and 19 th centuries
when they were more heavily-hopped versions of stronger
export stouts. Vatted originally, but Guinness stopped this
practice in the 1950s. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (originally,
West India Porter, later Foreign Extra Double Stout) was first
brewed in 1801 according to Guinness with “extra hops to give
it a distinctive taste and a longer shelf life in hot weather.”

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Pale and dark roasted malts
and grains, historically also could have used brown and amber
malts. Hops mostly for bitterness, typically English varieties.
May use adjuncts and sugar to boost gravity.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Similar in balance to an Irish Extra
Stout, but with more alcohol. Not as big or intense as an
Imperial Stout. Lacking the strong bitterness and high late
hops of American Stout. Similar gravity as Tropical Stout, but
with a drier finish and higher bitterness.
