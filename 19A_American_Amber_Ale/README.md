<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 19 Amber and Brown American Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 19A American Amber Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> An amber, hoppy, moderate-strength
American craft beer with a malty caramel flavor. The balance
can vary quite a bit, with some versions being fairly malty and
others being aggressively hoppy. Hoppy and bitter versions
should not have clashing flavors with the caramel malt profile.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to moderate hop aroma reflective of American or
New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resin, spice,
tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon). A citrusy hop
character is common, but not required. Moderately-low to
moderately-high maltiness, usually with a moderate caramel
character, that can either support, balance, or sometimes mask
the hop presentation. Esters vary from moderate to none.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep amber to coppery-brown in color,
sometimes with a reddish hue. Moderately large off-white head
with good retention. Generally quite clear.

<b>Flavor:</b> Moderate to high hop flavor with similar
characteristics as the aroma. Malt flavors are moderate to
strong, and usually show an initial malty sweetness followed by
a moderate caramel flavor and sometimes toasty or biscuity
malt flavors in lesser amounts. Dark or roasted malt flavors
absent. Moderate to moderately-high bitterness. Balance can
vary from somewhat malty to somewhat bitter. Fruity esters
can be moderate to none. Caramel sweetness, hop flavor, and
bitterness can linger somewhat into the medium to full yet dry
finish.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-full body. Medium to high
carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency.
Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth.

<b>Comments:</b> Can overlap in color with darker American pale
ales, but with a different malt flavor and balance. A range of
balance exists in this style, from balanced and malty to more
aggressively hopped.

<b>History:</b> A modern American craft beer style developed as a
variation from American Pale Ales. Mendocino Red Tail Ale
was first made in 1983, and was known regionally as a Red Ale.
This served as the progenitor of Double Reds (American Strong
Ale), Red IPAs, and other hoppy, caramelly beers.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Neutral pale ale malt. Medium
to dark crystal malts. American or New World hops, often with
citrusy flavors, are common but others may also be used.
Neutral to lightly estery yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Darker, more caramelly, more body, and
generally less bitter in the balance than American Pale Ales.
Less alcohol, bitterness, and hop character than Red IPAs. Less
strength, malt, and hop character than American Strong Ales.
Less chocolate and dark caramel than an American Brown Ale.
