<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 8 Dark European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 08A Munich Dunkel

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A traditional malty brown lager from
Bavaria. Deeply toasted, bready malt flavors without any roasty
or burnt flavors. Smooth and rich, with a restrained bitterness
and a relatively dry finish that allows for drinking in quantity.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate to high malt richness, like toasted bread
crusts with hints of chocolate, nuts, caramel, or toffee. Fresh
traditional versions often show higher levels of chocolate. The
malt character is more malty-rich than sugary or caramelly
sweet. Clean fermentation profile. A light spicy, floral, or herbal
hop aroma is optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep copper to dark brown, often with a red or
garnet tint. Creamy, light to medium tan head. Usually clear.

<b>Flavor:</b> Rich malt flavors similar to aroma (same malt
descriptors apply), medium to high. Restrained bitterness,
medium-low to medium, giving an overall malty balance. Malty
and soft on the palate without being overly sweet, and medium-
dry in the finish with a malty aftertaste. No roast, burnt, or
bitter malt flavors, toasted flavors shouldn’t have a harsh
grainy dryness, and caramel flavors should not be sweet. Low
spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor optional. Clean fermentation
profile.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-full body, providing a soft
and dextrinous mouthfeel without being heavy or cloying.
Moderate carbonation. Smooth lager character. No harsh or
biting astringency. Not warming.

<b>Comments:</b> A traditional Munich style, the dark companion
to Helles. Franconian versions are more bitter than ones from
Munich.

<b>History:</b> Developed at Spaten in the 1830s after the
development of Munich malt, and seen as a successor to dark
regional beers of the time. While originating in Munich, the
style became popular throughout Bavaria (especially
Franconia).

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Traditionally, Munich malts,
but Pils and Vienna can be used too. Light use of specialty
malts for color and depth. Decoction mash traditional. German
hops and lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Not as intense in maltiness or as strong
as a Dunkles Bock. Lacking the more roasted flavors and often
the hop bitterness of a Schwarzbier. Richer, more malt-centric,
and less hoppy than a Czech Dark Lager.
