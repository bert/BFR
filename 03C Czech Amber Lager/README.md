<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 03C Czech Amber Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A malty amber Czech lager with a hop
character that can vary from low to quite significant. The malt
flavors also can vary, leading to different interpretations and
balances ranging from drier, bready, and slightly biscuity to
sweeter and somewhat caramel-like.

<b>Aroma:</b> Moderate intensity, rich malt aroma that can be
either bready and Maillard product-dominant or slightly
caramelly sweet. Spicy, floral, or herbal hop character may be
moderate to none. Clean lager character, though low fruity
esters (stone fruit or berries) may be present. Low diacetyl
optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep amber to copper color. Clear to bright
clarity. Large, off-white, persistent head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Complex malt flavor is dominant (medium to
medium-high), though its nature may vary from dry and
Maillard product-dominant to caramelly and almost sweet.
Some examples have a candy-like to graham-cracker malt
character. Low to moderate spicy hop flavor. Prominent but
clean hop bitterness provides a balanced finish. Subtle plum or
berry esters optional. Low diacetyl optional. No roasted malt
flavor. Finish may vary from dry and hoppy to relatively sweet.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to medium body. Soft and round,
often with a gentle creaminess. Moderate to low carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> The Czech name of the style is polotmavé pivo,
which translates as half-dark beer. This style is a combination
of the Czech styles polotmavý ležák (11–12.9 °P) and
polotmavé speciální pivo (13–14.9 °P). Some versions may be a
blend of pale and dark lagers.

<b>History:</b> A Vienna-style lager which has continued to be
brewed in the Czech Republic. A resurgence of small breweries
opening in the Czech Republic has increased the number of
examples of this style.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Pilsner and caramel malts, but
Vienna and Munich malts may also be used. Low mineral
content water. Traditional Czech hops. Czech lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> The style can be similar to a Vienna
Lager but with stronger Czech late hop character, or that
approaching a British Bitter but significantly richer with more
of a deep caramel character. Large brewery versions are
generally similar to Czech Premium Pale Lager with slightly
darker malt flavors and less hop, while smaller breweries often
make versions with considerable hop character, malt
complexity, or residual sweetness.
