<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 16 Dark British Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 16A Sweet Stout

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A very dark, sweet, full-bodied, slightly
roasty stout that can suggest coffee-and-cream, or sweetened
espresso.

<b>Aroma:</b> Mild roasted grain aroma, sometimes with coffee or
chocolate notes. An impression of cream-like sweetness often
exists. Fruitiness can be low to moderately high. Low diacetyl
optional. Low floral or earthy hop aroma optional.

<b>Appearance:</b> Very dark brown to black in color. Clear, if not
opaque. Creamy tan to brown head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Dark, roasted, coffee or chocolate flavors dominate
the palate. Low to moderate fruity esters. Moderate bitterness.
Medium to high sweetness provides a counterpoint to the
roasted character and bitterness, lasting into the finish. The
balance between dark grains or malts and sweetness can vary,
from quite sweet to moderately dry and somewhat roasty. Low
diacetyl optional. Low floral or earthy hop flavor optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-full to full-bodied and creamy. Low to
moderate carbonation. High residual sweetness from
unfermented sugars enhances the full-tasting mouthfeel.

<b>Comments:</b> Gravities are low in Britain (sometimes lower
than the statistics below), higher in exported and US products.
Variations exist, with the level of residual sweetness, the
intensity of the roast character, and the balance between the
two being the variables most subject to interpretation.

<b>History:</b> An English style of stout developed in the early
1900s. Historically known as “Milk” or “Cream” stouts, legally
this designation is no longer permitted in England but may be
acceptable elsewhere. The “milk” name is derived from the use
of the milk sugar lactose as a sweetener. Originally marketed as
a tonic for invalids and nursing mothers.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Base of pale malt with dark
malts or grains. May use grain or sugar adjuncts. Lactose is
frequently added to provide additional residual sweetness.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Much sweeter and less bitter-tasting than
other stouts, except the stronger Tropical Stout. The roast
character is mild, not burnt like other stouts. Can be similar in
balance to Oatmeal Stout, albeit with more sweetness.
