<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 8 Dark European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 08B Schwarzbier

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A dark German lager that balances
roasted yet smooth malt flavors with moderate hop bitterness.
The lighter body, dryness, and lack of a harsh, burnt, or heavy
aftertaste helps make this beer quite drinkable.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to moderate malt, with low aromatic malty
sweetness and hints of roast malt often apparent. The malt can
be clean and neutral or moderately rich and bready, and may
have a hint of dark caramel. The roast character can be
somewhat dark chocolate- or coffee-like but should never be
burnt. A moderately low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is
optional. Clean lager yeast character.

<b>Appearance:</b> Medium to very dark brown in color, often with
deep ruby to garnet highlights, yet almost never truly black.
Very clear. Large, persistent, tan-colored head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Light to moderate malt flavor, which can have a clean,
neutral character to a moderately rich, bread-malty quality.
Light to moderate roasted malt flavors can give a bitter-
chocolate palate that is never burnt. Medium-low to medium
bitterness. Light to moderate spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor.
Clean lager character. Dry finish. Some residual sweetness is
acceptable but not traditional. Aftertaste of hop bitterness with
a complementary but subtle roastiness in the background.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to
moderately-high carbonation. Smooth. No harshness or
astringency, despite the use of dark, roasted malts.

<b>Comments:</b> Literally means black beer in German. While
sometimes called a “black Pils,” the beer is rarely as dark as
black or as hop-forward and bitter as a Pils. Strongly roasted,
Porter-like flavors are a flaw.

<b>History:</b> A regional specialty from Thuringia, Saxony, and
Franconia in Germany. Served as the inspiration for black
lagers brewed in Japan. Popularity grew after German
reunification in 1990.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> German Munich malt and
Pilsner malts for the base, with huskless dark roasted malts
that add roast flavors without burnt flavors. German hop
varieties and clean German lager yeasts are traditional.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> In comparison with a Munich Dunkel,
usually darker in color, drier on the palate, lighter in body, and
with a noticeable (but not high) roasted malt edge to balance
the malt base. Should not taste like an American Porter made
with lager yeast. Drier, less malty, with less hop character than
a Czech Dark Lager.
