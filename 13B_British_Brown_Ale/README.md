<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 13 Brown British Beer

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 13B British Brown Ale

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A malty, caramelly, brown British ale
without the roasted flavors of a Porter. Balanced and flavorful,
but usually a little stronger than most average UK beers.

<b>Aroma:</b> Light, sweet malt aroma with toffee, nutty, or light
chocolate notes, and a light to heavy caramel quality. A light
but appealing floral or earthy hop aroma may also be noticed. A
light fruity aroma may be evident, but should not dominate.

<b>Appearance:</b> Dark amber to dark reddish-brown color. Clear.
Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Gentle to moderate malt sweetness, with a light to
heavy caramel character, and a medium to dry finish. Malt may
also have a nutty, toasted, biscuity, toffee, or light chocolate
character. Medium to medium-low bitterness. Malt-hop
balance ranges from even to malt-focused. Low floral or earthy
hop flavor optional. Low to moderate fruity esters optional.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-light to medium body. Medium to
medium-high carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> A wide-ranging category with different
interpretations possible, ranging from lighter-colored to hoppy
to deeper, darker, and caramel-focused; however, none of the
versions have strongly roasted flavors. A stronger Double
Brown Ale was more popular in the past, but is very hard to
find now. While London Brown Ales are marketed using the
name Brown Ale, we list those as a different judging style due
to the significant difference in balance (especially sweetness)
and alcohol strength; that doesn’t mean that they aren’t in the
same family, though.

<b>History:</b> Brown ale has a long history in Great Britain,
although different products used that name at various times.
Modern brown ale is a 20 th century creation; it is not the same
as historical products with the same name. A wide range of
gravities were brewed, but modern brown ales are generally of
the stronger (by current UK standards) interpretation. This
style is based on the modern stronger British brown ales, not
historical versions or the sweeter London Brown Ale described
in the Historical Beer category. Predominantly but not
exclusively a bottled product currently.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> British mild ale or pale ale malt
base with caramel malts. May also have small amounts darker
malts (e.g., chocolate) to provide color and the nutty character.
English hop varieties are most authentic.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> More malty balance than British Bitters,
with more malt flavors from darker grains. Stronger than a
Dark Mild. Less roast than an English Porter. Stronger and
much less sweet than London Brown Ale.
