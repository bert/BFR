<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 6 Amber Malty European Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 06C Dunkles Bock

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A strong, dark, malty German lager
beer that emphasizes the malty-rich and somewhat toasty
qualities of continental malts without being sweet in the finish.

<b>Aroma:</b> Medium to medium-high rich bready-malty aroma,
often with moderate amounts of rich Maillard products or
toasty overtones. Virtually no hop aroma. Some alcohol may be
noticeable. Clean lager character, although a slight dark fruit
character is allowable.

<b>Appearance:</b> Light copper to brown color, often with
attractive garnet highlights. Good clarity despite the dark color.
Large, creamy, persistent, off-white head.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium to medium-high complex, rich maltiness is
dominated by toasty-rich Maillard products. Some dark
caramel notes may be present. Hop bitterness is generally only
high enough to support the malt flavors, allowing a bit of malty
sweetness to linger into the finish. Well-attenuated, not
cloying. Clean fermentation profile, although the malt can
provide a slight dark fruit character. No hop flavor. No roasted,
burnt, or dry biscuity character.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium to medium-full bodied. Moderate to
moderately low carbonation. Some alcohol warmth may be
found, but should never be hot. Smooth, without harshness or
astringency.

<b>Comments:</b> Decoction mashing plays an important part of
flavor development, as it enhances the caramel and Maillard
flavor aspects of the malt.

<b>History:</b> Originated in the Northern German city of Einbeck,
which was a brewing center and popular exporter in the days of
the Hanseatic League (14 th to 17 th century). Recreated in
Munich starting in the 17th century. “Bock” translates to “Ram”
in German, which is why the animal is often used in logos and
advertisements.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Munich and Vienna malts,
rarely a tiny bit of dark roasted malts for color adjustment,
never any non-malt adjuncts. Continental European hop
varieties are used. Clean German lager yeast.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Darker, with a richer malty flavor and
less apparent bitterness than a Helles Bock. Less alcohol and
malty richness than a Doppelbock. Stronger malt flavors and
higher alcohol than a Märzen. Richer, less attenuated, and less
hoppy than a Czech Amber Lager.
