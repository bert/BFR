<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 14 Scottish Ale

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 14A Scottish Light

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A low-alcohol, malty beer with light
caramel, toast, toffee, and fruit flavors. A slight roast dryness
offsets the residual sweetness in the finish, with the bitterness
perceived only to keep the beer from being cloying.

<b>Aroma:</b> Low to medium maltiness with caramel and toffee
notes, and light toasty and sugary qualities that might be
reminiscent of toasted breadcrumbs, ladyfingers, English
biscuits, graham crackers, or butterscotch. Light pome
fruitiness and light English hop aroma (earthy, floral, orange-
citrus, spicy, etc.) allowable.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep copper to dark brown. Clear. Low to
moderate, creamy off-white.

<b>Flavor:</b> Medium toasty-bready malt with caramel and toffee
overtones, finishing with a slightly roasty dryness. A wide
range of caramelized sugar and toasted bread type of flavors
are possible, using similar descriptors as the aroma. Clean
maltiness and fermentation profile. Light esters and hop flavor
allowable (similar descriptors as aroma). Sufficient bitterness
to not be cloying, but with a malty balance and aftertaste.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Medium-low to medium body. Low to moderate
carbonation. Maybe be moderately creamy.

<b>Comments:</b> See category introduction for detailed comments.
May not seem as bitter as specifications indicate due to higher
finishing gravity and residual sweetness. Typically a draught
product, but somewhat rare. Do not mis-perceive the light
roasty dryness as smoke; smoke is not present in these beers.

<b>History:</b> See category introduction. The Shilling ale names
were used for mild (unaged) beer before World War I, but the
styles took modern form only after World War II.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> At its simplest, pale ale malt,
but can also use colored malt, sugars, corn, wheat, crystal
malts, colorants, and a variety of other grains. Clean yeast. Soft
water. No peat-smoked malt.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> See category introduction. Similar to
other Scottish Ales but lower in alcohol, and darker in color.
Similar in strength to the low end of Dark Mild, but with a
different flavor profile and balance.
