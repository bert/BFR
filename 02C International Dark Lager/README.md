<b>BJCP 2021 Category:</b> 2 International Lager

<b>BJCP 2021 Style:</b> 02C International Dark Lager

<b>Overall Impression:</b> A darker, richer, and somewhat
sweeter version of international pale lager with a little more
body and flavor, but equally restrained in bitterness. The low
bitterness leaves the malt as the primary flavor element, and
the low hop levels provide very little in the way of balance.

<b>Aroma:</b> Faint malt aroma. Medium-low roast and caramel
malt aroma optional. Light spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma
optional. Clean fermentation profile.

<b>Appearance:</b> Deep amber to very dark brown with bright
clarity and ruby highlights. Foam stand may not be long
lasting, and is beige to light tan in color.

<b>Flavor:</b> Low to medium sweet maltiness. Medium-low
caramel or roasted malt flavors optional, possibly with hints of
coffee, molasses, brown sugar, or cocoa. Low floral, spicy, or
herbal hop flavor optional. Low to medium bitterness. May
have a very light fruitiness. Moderately crisp finish. The
balance is typically somewhat malty. Burnt or moderately
strong roasted malt flavors are inappropriate.

<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Light to medium-light body. Smooth with a light
creaminess. Medium to high carbonation.

<b>Comments:</b> A broad range of international lagers that are
darker than pale, and not assertively bitter or roasted.

<b>History:</b> Darker versions of International Pale Lagers often
created by the same large, industrial breweries and meant to
appeal to a broad audience. Often either a colored or sweetened
adaptation of the standard pale industrial lager, or a more
broadly accessible (and inexpensive) version of more
traditional dark lagers.

<b>Characteristic Ingredients:</b> Two- or six-row barley with
corn, rice, or sugars adjuncts. Light use of caramel and darker
roasted malts. Commercial versions may use coloring agents.

<b>Style Comparison:</b> Less flavor and richness than Munich
Dunkel, Schwarzbier, or other dark lagers. Frequently uses
adjuncts, as is typical of other International Lagers.
